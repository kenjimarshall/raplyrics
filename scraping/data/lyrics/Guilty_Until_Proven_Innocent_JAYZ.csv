Took me one point eight but I had to get it straight,0
"Get the CD, twelve inch vinyl, get the tape",1
"Jigga give out food for thought dog, get a plate",1
"I get it down, get it crunk when I get in the state of mind",1

"Arrested, put in the lineup, trying to put dents in my armor",0
"But I'm a survivor, plus I'm liver than most",0

"You heard the rhetoric: ""Jigga hit me over the head",1
"With a champagne bottle at the bar, can he buy me a car?""",1
