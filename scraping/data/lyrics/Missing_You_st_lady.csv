Hmmmmm hmmmmm,0
Oh I'm missin' you,0
Baby I'm missin' you,0
Mmm eyyy hmmm,0
Baby I'm missing you,0
Things'll never be the same with out you...,0
What did I do to deserve this,0
"I didn't even get one last kiss, from you",0
Oh baby God took your love from me,0
You needed an angel so it seems,0
I need to feel your hands all over me,0
I need to feel you kissing me,0
I need to feel you holding me,0
I need to feel your touch,0
Cause I miss your love so much,0
And I can't keep on living this way,0
I need you here with me,0
"Why did he take you away, from me",0
It's hard for me to tell you I love you,1
As I'm standing over your grave,1
And I know I'll never hear your voice again,1
Why did you leave me,0
Why couldn't you just stay,0
"Because my world is nothing, without you",0
"Now I don't know what to do, with myself",0
I would've given you anything,0
Just to make you happy,0
"Just to hear you say, that you love me one last time",0
I'd go to hell back over and over again,0
Just to prove to you how much I need you here,0
There is nothing that I wouldn't do,0
I'd cry for you,0
I'd lie for you,0
And there's no doubt that if I could take your place in heaven,0
"I would die for you, yes I will",0
I would rather give up my life,0
Than to see tears in your eyes,0
I can't stand to see you cry,0
Cause it's hard for me to tell you I love you,0
As I'm standing over your grave,0
And I know I'll never hear your voice again,0
Why did you leave me,0
Why couldn't you just stay babe,0
"Because my world is nothing, without you",0
"Now I don't know what to do, with myself",0
I just don’t know what to do with myself,1
I can’t stop looking at those pictures on my shelf,1
"Knowing it was just one week ago, stood there and took that picture",1
There just one thing that I want to know,0
Why would God want to hurt me so bad,0
Does He know how much it hurts to be missing you,0
Baby I’m missing you,0
Baby I’m missing you,0
I love you oohh God dammit I love you,0
Why did he did he take you away from me,0
Cause I love you so...,0
I miss you so much baby I just can’t go on baby,0
Ohhh,0
