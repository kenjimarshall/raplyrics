Went on out and bought it 'cause I thought it would be jammin',1
"But examine all the flawsky-wawsky,",1

"Sad and it's costly, but that's all she",1
Wrote,1

"Up shit's creek, ""It's weak"" is the last quote",1
That I wanna hear when I'm goin' down,1
When all's said and done,1

When the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down,1
"All y'all can say is, ""Them niggas earned that crown"", but until then",1
