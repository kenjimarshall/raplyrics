So you're still thinking of me,1
Just like I know you should,1
"I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could",1
I'm so high at the moment,1
I'm so caught up in this,1
"Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke",0
But we still got love to give,0
[Chorus],0
While we're young dumb,1
"Young, young dumb and broke",1
Young dumb,1
"Young, young dumb and broke",1
Young dumb,1
Young dumb,1
"Young, young dumb and broke",1

We have so much in common,1
We argue all the time,1
You always say I'm wrong,1
I'm pretty sure I'm right,1
What's fun about commitment?,1
When we have our life to live,1
