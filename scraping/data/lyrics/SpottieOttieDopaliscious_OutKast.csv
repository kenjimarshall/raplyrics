"Leanin', checking out the scene",0
"Gangsta boys, Bigga's lit",0
"Ridin' out, talkin' shit",0
"Nigga, where you wanna go?",0
You know the club don't close 'til four,1
Let's party 'til we can't no more,0
"Watch out here come the folk, ""Damn""",0
"Oh, Lord",0
[Verse 2: André 3000],0
As the plot thickens,1
"It gives me the dickens, reminiscent of Charles",1
"A lil' discotheque nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville, USA",1
"Via Atlanta, Georgia",1
A lil' spot where young men and young women go to experience they first little taste of the night life,0
"Me? Well, I've never been there",1
"Well, perhaps, once, but I was so engulfed in the Olde E, I never made it to the door",1
You speak of hardcore,1
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems and troubles of the day,1
While this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors,1
Lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear,1
"Competing with ""Set it Off,"" in the right",1
"But it all blends perfectly, if you let the liquor tell it",1
"""Hey hey look baby they playin' our song""",0
And the crowd goes wild as if Holyfield has just won the fight,1
But in actuality it's only about 3 A.M,1
And three niggas just don' got hauled,1
"Off in the ambulance, sliced up",1
"Two niggas don' start bustin', ""wham! wham!""",1
"And one nigga done took his shirt off, talkin' 'bout",1
"""Now who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Court?""",1
It's just my interpretation of the situation,1

[Verse 3: Big Boi],1
"Yes, when I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious Angel",1
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday,0
The way she moved reminded me of a Brown Stallion,1
"Horse with skates on, ya know",1
Smooth like a hot comb on nappy ass hair,1
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed,0
Her neck was smelling sweeter,1
Than a plate of yams with extra syrup,1
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece just blindin' a nigga,0
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential,1
My heart was beating so damn fast,1
Never knowing this moment would bring another,1
Life into this world,1
Funny how shit come together sometimes (ya dig),1
One moment you frequent the booty clubs and,1
The next four years you & somebody's daughter,1
Raisin' y'all own young'n now that's a beautiful thang,1
That's if you're on top of your game,1
"And man enough to handle real life situations, that is",1
Can't gamble feeding baby on that dope money,1
Might not always be sufficient but the,1
United Parcel Service & the people at the Post Office,1
Didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss,1
"So now you back in the trap just that, trapped",1
Go on and marinate on that for a minute,1
