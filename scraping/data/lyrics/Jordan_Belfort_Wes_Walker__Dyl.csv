I've been getting dirty money; Jordan Belfort,1
Stacking penny stocks while I'm flipping these birds,1
"Sipping on Ciroc, trip 'em up with the words",1
I just popped a molly and I think this be my third,1

"I just flipped a birdy, money so dirty",1
"Got my bitch a mink, furry like Furby",1
"I came up, made a milly, spent it on a rollie",1
"Stackin gouda, feta, chedda cheese and ravioli",1
"Or maybe fettuccine,",1
dirty martini,1
"I'ma fuck your bitch,  call me Houdini",1
"I'm drivin' Lamborghini, your ho in a bikini",1
"Eight bottles to the neck, three wishes from a genie",1
"Benjamin ain't dirty, but these Franklins be filthy",1
"Always going to court, but I'm never pleadin' guilty",1
Ballin' so hard I only be slam dunkinâ€™,1
Beat steady rock and the trunk straight thumpin',1
"I be ridin' foreign, pourin' merlot while I swerve",1
Pedal to the medal when I'm whippin' round the curb,1
"And I'm rollin' up this marijuana, you can smell the herb",1
"And I be getting all this lettuce, I ain't talkin' iceberg",1

"Jordan Belfort, Burberry shirt",1
LV loafers on my sofa in Bel-Air,1
Turnin' up daily cause we can't turn down at work,1
I been lightin' loud lately like my volume switch don't work,1
"And my cologne is Versace,",1
Medusa got me stoned,1
"I'm always high on something, but I usually like to smoke",1
"We been long time friends, me and Ben Frank",1
Every fucking day he needs a ride home from the bank,1
"Muhfucka, you don't know me, you ain't in my tax section",1
"My wallet ain't fat, it's in the gym straight flexing",1
I don't call your bitch back and she's checkin' her reception,1
"Bitch with double D's, she's all up on my erection",1
"And I'm in the ovaries, but I ain't about affection",1
So easily the sober me just smokes and then forgets them,1
Sometimes this life seems a little stressful,1
Especially when they tell me that I am something special,1
