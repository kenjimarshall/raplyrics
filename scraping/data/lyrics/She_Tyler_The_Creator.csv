[Verse 1: Frank Ocean],1
Golden rubbers in these denim pockets,1
"On my waist, there's a black Glock",0
New girl moved on the block,0
She been plottin' on my brown cock,0
Last night I slept over hers,1
"During sex, I overheard",1
"A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na",1
"Rolled off the bed, then shot back, pow-pow",1
"Blood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash",1
"Looked out the glass, seen you sprintin' on the grass",1
"A real ninja, with the blade and the mask",0
"Had them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks",1
"Now she tryna patch me up, but",0
"Girl, I was just tryna get a nut bust",0
"If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol",0
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude,0
[Chorus: Frank Ocean],1
The blinds wide open so he can,0
See you in the dark when you're sleepin',0
"Naked body, fresh out the shower",0
You touch yourself after hours,1
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom,1
You're sleeping alone in bed,1
But check your window (Swag),0
He's at your window,0
"[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]",0
"Night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites",1
"I'm a down to Earth nigga, with intentions, that's right",1
You'll be down in Earth quicker if you diss me tonight,1
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight,0
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck,0
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one,0
But I give two for us cause you're the one that I want,0
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy,1
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front,1
But in the back of my top I'm writing songs about we,1
"We, as including I, and yourself, making three",1
"Little ones,",1
the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me,0
You're a pretty broad in the top three,1
"Of things that I've been waiting to come, so",1
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then,1
"We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn",1
From Adventurin' Time,1
[Chorus: Frank Ocean],0
The blinds wide open so he can,0
See you in the dark when you're sleepin',0
"Naked body, fresh out the shower",1
You touch yourself after hours,1
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom,1
You're sleeping alone in bed,1
But check your window,0
He's at your window,0
"[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]",0
"One, two; you're the girl that I want",0
"Three, four, five, six, seven; shit",0
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this,0
"And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous",1
"Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous",1
I just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest,1
And fornicate with it,1
"But that's because I'm in love with you, cunt",1
"[Bridge 2: Tyler, The Creator]",0
"I just wanna talk, and conversate",1
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate,1
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date,1
"So just say yes, let the future fall into place (Cunt)",1
"I just wanna talk, and conversate",0
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate,0
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date,0
"So just say yes, let the future fall into place, cunt",0
[Chorus: Frank Ocean],0
