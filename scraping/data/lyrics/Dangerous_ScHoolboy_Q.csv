[Chorus: Kid Cudi],0
"I'm feeling dangerous, I'm feeling nauseous",1
"Road left me crazy, soaring, I wanna",1
"Smoking and faded, I got enormous",1
"Drinkin' and swangin', I'm feelin' dangerous",1
[Verse: ScHoolboy Q],0
Greet me by my hand 'til you teach me to float,1
Head is in the cloud with my stomach below,1
"Somethin' 'bout this feeling, I felt it before",1
Took this pill and it swallowed me whole,1
"Pinch me on my arm, is it Heaven or fun?",1
"If I don't come back, had a hell of a run",1
"Taste you through my nose, smell the death on the tongue",1
"Can't get high enough to get over the hump, huh",1
How many friends around me helping me lose?,1
How many excuses until I'm excused?,1
"Shadow my morning, I ain't dreaming it right",0
Ain't no way a flower could bloom in the night,0
"Family tried to warn me, couldn't keep me away",0
"'Til I figure flying, I better escape",0
But flying ain't flying when you're stuck on your ass,0
"Pleasure took my driver and caused me to crash, uh",0
"Took me forever, we was stuck in the mud",1
Chicken crossed the road to get out of the hood,1
"Was drawing this darker feeling, feeling my face",0
Somebody go hand my drug dealer a case (Case),0
Bass on the Perc' and activating the sub (Sub),0
"Sold my heart and soul, that's a hell of a drug (Drug)",0
"Take this here, introduce you to love, uh",0
"Take this here, introduce you to love",0
[Outro: Kid Cudi],0
"I'm feeling dangerous (Hmm), I'm feeling nauseous",1
"Road left me crazy (Hmm), soaring, I wanna",1
I'm feeling dangerous,1
