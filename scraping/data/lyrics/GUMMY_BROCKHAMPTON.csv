"These niggas take me for granted, what would hap' if I vanish?",0
"Bet a hunnid they'd panic, my shooters only speak Spanish",1
"Keep my heart with my dogs, keep my car in the yard",1
I can't drive it nowhere so I'll let you niggas take off,1

And he 'bout 20 and shit? When he let go of that shit?,1
"He'll prolly be a little colder, y'all agree with me? Shit",1
"That nigga need to act his age, he ain't acting like a grown up",1

"Step off the ship with the slaves, then I go hit the stage",1
"I just left in a whip, all I need is a chain",1

"'Cause people talk too much, I bought a black fo'-fifth",1
"And a brand new clip, that's my new best friend",1
"'Cause I'm a brand new nigga, in a brand new crib",1
"I ain't sellin' no more, but got my hand in the zip",1
"Whitey gave me the check, I ain't ask for the fame",1
I used to deal with the grams 'til they put the cam on my face,1
"Now I'm evading the law, I'm on a high-speed chase",1
"I'm in a big-ass truck, I tell 'em, ""Get out the way""",1

How I'm gon' move at your pace? I'm busy settin' the tone,1
You think we runnin' together? I'm in a lane of my own,1
"Don't got no friends in this game, it's me and my brothers alone",1
"They thinkin' that we competing, that shit depletin' my bones",1
"I don't need all that energy, they just fuck up my chakras",1
"I put my heart in a locker,",1
they love me when I'm a martyr,1
"They hate me when I'm myself, I can't barter with that",1
"You watch us charter these tracks, it's sticking like tartar and plaque",1
"I need a parlour of plaques, need lobsters and helicopters",1
"I need peace for my niggas, need darker skin for all my doctors",1
"I like to speak like a scholar, like to think like a nigga",0
"In this world I can't wander, no honor behind the trigger",1
I could get shot in my back and they'd tell the world that I fought 'em,1
"""We ain't taught 'em nothin' new, but somehow they been gettin' smarter""",1
"That's what they sayin' in private, speaking from that entitlement",1
We still workin' for titles and makin' tidal environments,1
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract],1
"Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me",1
"Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine",1

"I'm stuck on some bud I hit, under concrete canopy",0
"Fuck all this energy, you just wanna bring me down",0
"Fuck all your energy, you just wanna bring me down",0
"Fuck, put the windows up, blowin' past the exit now",0
"Up like a money shot, swerve into the sunset",0
"Me and all my boys jet, swerving like a doughnut",1
"Off, off, off, off, swerving like a doughnut",1
