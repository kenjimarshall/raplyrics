[Chorus: J Hus],0
Smiling like a nice person,0
"Came on a Rambo ting, everyting camouflaging",1
"Looking like a bulletproof vest, nah, that's just a body warmer",1
"Big man gossiping, there's noting worser",0
I swear I'm a father for them man,0
Bring something larger for them man,0
"Disaster, disaster for them man",0
"Them man, them man, them man there",0
"Make a one trip there, just to make a one ting clear",0
Then fly out to Edinburgh,0
"I'm so fly, I might just pop my collar",0
Need a zoobie to roll,1
Left eye look through your soul,0
I'm blinded by love while I'm winking at you,0
I'm thinking out loud so you know I'm always thinking 'bout you,0
"Same time, I don't think I'm too irrational",0
[Verse: Dave &,0
J Hus,0
],0
Fuck beefing with babies,0
Catch a man raving,0
"We're taking your paper, your 'yac and your ladies",1
"Fistfight, this bitch bites like it's rabies",1
"Drop from your baby, catch him there",0
I'm standing here,1
Bumped into Dave by the Santander,1
You was in the same spot you was in last year,0
"You said, ""Life ain't fair""",0
I know man who live life in fear,0
This time last year,0
"You were on the same block, standing there",0
"Smoking, gossiping, chatting bare",0
Don't tell me that you ain't involved,0
Them JME 'cause a man don't care,1
"Man don't business, love no witness",0
"Hug no traitor, spud no snitches",1
"Man try live this, never knew he had a clitoris",1
"Have man for breakfast, talk about hit list",0
"I bring the fire, you liar and a backstabber",0
I'm with the born-chasers or I'm with the cash grabbers,0
"I'm doing mathematics, automatic, never static",0
And,0
"she don't know my real name, she thought I was Patrick",1
Sit back and smoke a baseball bat,1
You think this is the life but it ain't all that,0
I've done some evil things that I wouldn't take back,0
I keep it to myself 'cause people wanna chat,0
"Keep it to yourself, people wanna talk",0
Flossing in the gossip's how you end up in a war,0
"I got nothing for a fed, copper for your head",1
And that's the definition of a penny for your thoughts,1
"We just live and maintain
We on the same streets but we don't play the same game
You're the type to get caught and go and play the blame game
You should be ashamed",0
"If I stick to my heart, I put my stick to your brain",0
"Let it rip for the pain, they put shit on my name, '",0
til I grip and I aim,0
Dip on a plane with a brand new name,0
"Mummy, I got a flight to catch",1
All for an internet gangster or a cyber-man,1
"Mike Myers man, a couple tries tried to try a man",1
"My boys put stars in the hood like I'm Stryder, man",1
I know people wearing Rollies doing life in can,1
Isn't that ironic that they couldn't find the time to plan?,1
"Still keep a faith in God, still couldn't spare the rod",0
"Marcel, you know me, I came with the blazing squad",1
You better pray to God whenever I'm in town,0
"Like a kid in a divorce, I'm leaving with your spouse",0
I can't make a horse or the river open its mouth,1
"You ain't got the drive, that's why you're in a drought",1
"Life's great, I'm in Sweden or Copenhagen",0
Getting brain from a Dane whose first name I can't pronounce,0
[Chorus: J Hus],0
Smiling like a nice person,0
"Came on a Rambo ting, everyting camouflaging",0
"Looking like a bulletproof vest, nah, that's just a body warmer",0
"Big man gossiping, there's noting worser",0
I swear I'm a father for them man,0
Bring something larger for them man,0
"Disaster, disaster for them man",0
"Them man, them man, them man there",0
"Make a one trip there, just to make a one ting clear",0
Then fly out to Edinburgh,0
"I'm so fly, I might just pop my collar",0
Need a zoobie to roll,0
Left eye look through your soul,0
I'm blinded by love while I'm winking at you,0
I'm thinking out loud so you know I'm always thinking 'bout you,0
