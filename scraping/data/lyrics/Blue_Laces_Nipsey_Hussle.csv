Ask you where you from and check yo' tats under yo' clothin',0
"Hustla, go hard make sure my knot swollen",0
"Fuck it, say the wrong hood, bullets explodin'",0
I trust few people these days 'cause that's golden,0
I seen niggas get killed for who they roll with,0
And chose to keep inside they circle,0
Satan sittin' on your sofa,0
Same nigga that shot you was the one you used to smoke with,0

"Dickies saggin' off my ass, walk with a hoodsta limp",0
"Two bricks on my white tee, same color cocaine",0
"I ain't talkin' dope, I mean the price of my gold chain",0

What happened to the code? Streets all in shambles,0
"Niggas powderin' they nose, put the shame to what we stand for",0
They think we on some kill another nigga shit,0
We really on some stay down and diligent,0

Young niggas gangbangin' for the thrill of it,0
"Pops was gone, moms was never home",0
But the streets was right there so they took you as they own,0
