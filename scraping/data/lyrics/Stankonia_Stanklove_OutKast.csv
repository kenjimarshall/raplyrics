[Intro],1
What does love look like?,1
Love looks like you,1
What does love love feel like?,1
Love feels like this,1
What does love smell like?,1
Love smells like us,1
[Verse 1: Andr√© 3000],0
You make me understand,1
What it means to be in l-o-v-e once again,1
"Why, must we fly so low?",1
"Are we 'fraid of heights, do kites get lost in the tow",1
[Chorus],0
Stank love,0
Stank love,0
Stank love,0
Stank love,0
[Verse 2: Sleepy Brown],0
Let me show your mind a new freaky side of love,1
Open up you flower please let me taste your love,1
"Honeysuckle sweet, can't stop till I get every drip drop on my tongue",1
"Hitting every spot of you, what you gonna do",1
Your body is the rhythm of the boom in the room,1
Up and down it seems to go,0
Oh my god I think I'm bout to explode,0
[Chorus],0
Stank love,0
Stank love,0
Stank love,0
Stank love,0
[Verse 3: Big Rube],1
My fingertips scan flesh so supple,1
No longer a couple like two in one skin,1
Where do you end and where do I begin,1
Both brains become one mind sensually,1
Every nerve becoming its own individual entity,0
"With its own lusts, its own needs to serve",0
Longing for the love of all the other nerves,0
As they writhe and twist in satisfaction,0
In the burning chill of pleasure we bathe,0
"Engulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave",0
"Of an impact so deep, but not one of destruction",0
"But of creation, elation in the re-making",0
"No faking in the relation, no taking in the relation",0
"Just giving of the persona, making love after making love",0
'Til ain't nothing but Stankonia,0
[Chorus],0
Stank love,0
Stank love,0
Stank love,0
Stank love,0
