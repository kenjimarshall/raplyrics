[Chorus],0
I don't give a fuck,0
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up,0
AC blowin' and my window down,0
Chunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town,0
I don't give a fuck,0
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up,0
AC blowin' and my window down,0
Chunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town,0
[Verse 1],0
"Look, my mama wanna know why I'm bangin'",0
She told me I'ma lose my life,0
"I ain't trippin', I'm a crip and I'ma do it right",0
'Fore I run from a nigga I'll lose the fight,0
"I gotta hustle, Mama, I'ma move the white",0
If I died and came back I'd do it twice,0
"Brainwashed by the block, it consumed my life",0
Cool nigga but a killa when the mood is right,0
Bullets have the dogs howlin' at the moon at night,0
"Mama, it's cold outside, ain't no hope outside",0
"Couple niggas gettin' money, most is broke outside",0
"Rocks in the house, sellin' dope outside",0
Reminiscin' on my niggas that got smoked outside,0
Suckas in the house when them locs outside,0
Hustla gotta eat when them folks outside,0
Got a burner on my lap and I'm dippin' in my bucket,0
"Life's a bitch, nigga, fuck it!",0
[Chorus],0
I don't give a fuck,0
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up,0
AC blowin' and my window down,0
Chunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town,0
I don't give a fuck,0
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up,0
AC blowin' and my window down,0
Chunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town,0
[Verse 2],0
"Chyeah, they say we probably die slangin', bangin', pressin' the line",0
All a nigga really got is my respect and my pride,0
"Got a chopper for the coppers, keep a TEC in the ride",0
"Every nigga got a limit, never step on the line",0
When the set say it's on I'm expected to ride,0
When the world say I'm on I got the set on my side,0
Matter fact a nigga got the set on my back,0
"Slauson boy, the world ain't ready for that",0
"Nigga, it's cold in my hood, ain't no hope in my hood",0
"Couple homies couldn't cope, smokin' dope in my hood",0
But I could never ever be from no other hood,0
And I could never ever leave my folks in the hood,0
Thank the Lord every morning that I woke in the hood,0
And summers that I rode chrome spokes in the hood,0
If I never sold a mil' off what I wrote in my hood,0
I ain't trippin' 'cause niggas know I spoke for my hood,0
[Chorus],0
I don't give a fuck,0
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up,0
AC blowin' and my window down,0
Chunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town,0
I don't give a fuck,0
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up,0
AC blowin' and my window down,0
Chunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town,0

[Intro: Nipsey Hussle],0
What up?,0
What it do?,0
Music Corner,0
I'd like to welcome everybody out tonight,0
Welcome all the new marathon members,0
To the experience of a lifetime,0
I need your hands up though,0
"Yeah, look",0
[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle],0
"I don't want your love, it’s not why I make music",0
"I owe myself, I told myself back then that I would do this",0
"And I always look so out of reach, it just seems so confusin'",0
"That I felt my place in life, a young black man, it's seems so useless",0
"But I don’t want no help, just let me suffer through this",0
The world would not know Jesus Christ if there was never Judas,0
This knife that's in my back'll be the the truth that introduced us,0
And the distance in between us is the proof of my conclusion,0
"So life is what you make it, I hope you make a movement",0
Hope your opportunity survives the opportunist,0
Hopin' as you walk across the sand you see my shoe print,0
"And you follow 'til it change your life, it’s all an evolution",0
And I hope you find your passion 'cause I found mine in this music,0
But I hope it’s not material 'cause that’s all an illusion,0
And they all in collusion,0
This racist institution double standard,0
Actin' like they not the reason we ruthless,0
But tonight,0
[Chorus: June Summers &,0
Nipsey Hussle,0
],0
"Tonight is my night, this is my moment",0
Feelin' bigger than life but I gotta own it,0
It's a victory,0
Let's make history,0
"Don't judge me by my progress
Look",0
[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle],0
Look at where I started and look at where I’m standin',0
Y’all can say it's luck but I know that it's plannin',0
Shout out to the pain that gave me understandin',0
"Shout out to my gang, it turned me to a savage",0
So niggas could say what they want to but I go through what you haven’t,0
"But it’s not ego driven, it’s not me boastin' and braggin'",0
"This road I chose to go down, hard to slow down when in traffic",0
"In order for me to grow, I had to let go of some habits",0
"And it's easy to say I’m on now 'cause you see it, and it happened",0
"But before it ever did, I had to believe and get it crackin'",0
"So I’m gon' take you back then, 32 shots and my MAC-10",0
"With a dream minus the means, my early teens was fuckin' tragic",0
And deep inside my mind is buried crimes you can’t imagine,0
"That I wrestle with at night, demons that I fight I can’t get past it",0
"So no matter how straight your cash get, it don’t matter if you plastic",0
We was lookin' for the lights and all we stumbled 'cross was flashes,0
But tonight,0
[Chorus: June Summers],0
"Tonight is my night, this is my moment",0
Feelin' bigger than life but I gotta own it,0
It's a victory,0
Let's make history,0
[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle],0
"So if it’s meant, then it’s gon' be",0
People love it 'cause they know that this the real me,0
"The cops hate it, so they hope my homies kill me",0
"But I ain't want the fame, I just wanted y’all to feel me",0
It’s my time so I’m goin' in,0
"We ball 'til we fall, fuck how the story ends",0
"I see these niggas hatin’, I know you hoes plottin'",0
I ain't worried 'bout it 'cause I know God got me (Got me),0
Got me (Got me),0
Got me (Got me),0
Say I know God got me (Got me),0
Got me (Got me),0
Got me (Got me),0
"Yeah, I know God got me (Got me)",0
Got me (Got me),0
Got me (Got me),0
"Yeah, I know God got me",0
"See, I ain't worried 'bout it",0
'Cause I know God got me (Got me),0
Got me (Got me),0
Got me (Got me),0
[Break: Nipsey Hussle],0
"Once in a lifetime shit, you know?",0
This song dedicated to everybody out there with a muthafuckin' dream,0

But I gotta own it,0

Shout out my big bro Black Sam,0
Shout out my nigga Fats,0
Shout out my bro Adam,0
Shout out my A and Bs,0
"You know what this is, it's the motherfuckin' marathon",0
