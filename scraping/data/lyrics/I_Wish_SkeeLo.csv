[Intro],0
"Hey, this is radio station WSKEE",0
We're taking calls on the wish line,0
Making your wacky wishes come true,0
Hello?,0
[Hook],0
"I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller",1
"I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her",1
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat,0
And a six four Impala,1
[Verse 1],0
I wish I was like six-foot-nine,1
so I can get with Leoshi,1
"'Cause she don't know me but, yo, she's really fine",0
"You know I see her all the time,",0
everywhere,1
I go,0
"And even in my dreams, I can scheme of ways to make her mine",0
'Cause I know she's livin' phat,0
"Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball, so how am I gonna compete with that?",1
'Cause when it comes to playing basketball,1
I'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all,1
So I just lean up on the wall,0
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls who came to watch their man ball,1
"Dag y'all! I never understood, black",0
"Why the jocks get the fly girls, and me, I get the hood rats",1
"I tell 'em, ""Scat, skittle, scabobble""",1
Got hit with a bottle and put in a hospital for talkin' that mess,0
"I confess, it's a shame",1
When you livin' in a city that's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name,1
"Glad I came, to my senses",0
"Like quick-quick, got sick-sick to my stomach,",0
overcometh,1
by thoughts,0
"Of me and her together, right?",0
"So when I asked her out, she said I wasn't her type",0
[Hook],0
"I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller",1
"I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her",1
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat,0
And a six four Impala,1
"I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller",1
"I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her",1
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat,0
And a six four Impala,1
[Verse 2],0
I wish I had a brand new car,0
"so far, I got this hatchback",1
"And everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at",0
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back,0
I got,0
an 8-track,1
", and a spare tire in the backseat,",0
but that's flat,1
And do you really wanna know what's really wack?,0
"See, I can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?",0
I heard that prom night is a bomb night,0
With a hood rat t'you can hold tight,0
"But really though, I'm Figaro",1
"When in my car, I can't even get a hello",0
"Well, so many people wanna cruise",0
Crenshaw,1
on Sunday,0
One day I'mma have to get in my car and go,0
You know I take the 110 until the 105,0
"Get off at Crenshaw, tell my homies, ""Look alive""",1
'Cause it's hard to survive,1
When you're living in a concrete jungle and these girls keep passing me by,1
"She looks fly, she looks fly",1
"Make me say, ""my, my, my""",1

[Bridge],0
I wish I was a little bit taller,1
I wish I was a baller,1
I wish I was a little bit taller,1
I wish I was a baller,1
"I wish I was a little bit taller, y'all",1
I wish I was a baller,1
I wish I was a little bit taller,1
I wish I was a baller,1
[Verse 3],0
"Hey, I wish I had my way",0
'Cause every day would be a Friday,1
", and you could even speed on the highway",0
I would play ghetto games,0
Name my kids ghetto names:,0
"Little Mookie,",1
"Big Al, Lorraine",0
"Yo, you know that's on the real",0
So if you're down on your luck then you should know just how I feel,0
'Cause if you don't want me around,0
"See, I go simple, I go easy,",0
I go Greyhound,1
"Hey, you, what's that sound?",1
Everybody look what's going down,1
"Ah, yes, ain't that fresh?",0
Everybody wants to get down like that,0
[Chorus],0
"I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller",1
"I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her",1
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat,0
And a six four Impala,1
"I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller",1
"I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her",1
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat,0
And a six four Impala,1
