[Chorus: Stormzy],0
Searchin' every corner of my mind,0
Lookin' for the answers I can't find,0
I have my reasons and life has its lessons and,0
I tried to be grateful and count all my blessings,0
But heavy is the head that wears the crown,1
[Verse 1: Stormzy],0
"Amen, in Jesus' name, yes I declare it",0
"Any little seed I receive, I have to share it",0
"Bruddas wanna break me down, I can't bear it",0
"But heavy is the head with the crown, I still wear it",1
"You can't hold me down, I still cope",0
"Rain falling down at the BRITs, I'm still soaked",1
"Tried put a hole in our ship, we'll build boats",0
"Two birds with one stone, I'll kill both (What?)",0
Pray I never lose and pray I never hit the shelf (Two),0
Promise if I do that you'll be checkin' on my health (Cool),0
If it's for my people I'll do anything to help,0
"If I do it out of love it's not to benefit myself, ooh",0
Gotta stay around but make a comeback too,0
I know my only mother wants her son back too,0
They sayin' I'm the voice of the young black youth,0
"And then I say ""Yeah, cool"" and then I bun my zoot",0
And now I'mâ€“,0

All these fancy ties and gold plaques,0

"Don't comment on my culture, you ain't qualified",0
Stab us in the back and then apologise,0
If you knew my story you'd be horrified,0
The irony of trappin' on a Boris bike,1
Gotta stay alive and save my brother as well,0
Look at all these legends on the cover of Elle,0
Long time comin' but we come to prevail,0
"I guess a little bit of heaven has to come with the hell, you know",0
