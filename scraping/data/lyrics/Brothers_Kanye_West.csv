"You should've lit cigars, when your baby was born",0
Should've shouted you out and dedicated a song (,0
"Oh, oh",0
),0
"I can say I was wrong, I can take the blame",0
'Cause brothers don't always have to share the same name,0
(,0
"Oh, oh",0

"We met when we was young, I forgot the grade",0
When last one to base was a rotten egg,0
Since then I done good and rotten things (,0
Brothers forever,0
),0
So I could tell you one thing (,0
Brothers forever,0
),0
As soon as I cut the grass low,0
It's easier to see the assholes,0
So I'm sorry for all the miscues,0
How about I admit that I miss you,0
I miss the fam and our brotherhood,0
I just wanna make sure that my brother's good,0
So I ain't embarrassed or above (,0
"Eh, eh",0

Flying out to Paris for a hug,1
Or picking up the phone just to call up (Ooh),1
Picking up the phone hope it's all love,1
"'Cause Jesus taught us love, so did Moses and Mohammed (",0
Ooh,0

"So nothing so atomic that we can't agree to drop it, chop it",0
Peace it up and get it poppin',0
And bury the hatchet so we can lock in (,0

I wish I had a PA system for all the brothers we love,0
For the ones that was missing but joined the cut where we from,0
"See how the DA did 'em, when they was hustling drugs",0
And that was in the city of brotherly love,1
See brothers are amused by other brother's reps,1
But it takes a real one to keep the other in check (Other in check),1
So this fraternity's for eternity (,0
Brothers forever,0
),0
And every rhyme I write is 25 to life (Brothers forever),1
Every dime I wife thought I was Brian McKnight,0
And my homies said that you should shine your light,0
And the groupies gave us the time of our life,0
And I think about those times when I'm flying a flight,0
And I knew we'd reconnect when the timing was right,0
"Man, I ain't spoke to you in like forever (",0
Brothers forever,0
),0
Maybe it's time we put the band back together,0
