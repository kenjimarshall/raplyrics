[Intro],0
Stress...,0
"Sunshine, shade, geyeah",0
[Verse 1],0
"I sold it all, from crack to opium",1
"In third person, I don't wanna see 'em",1
So I'm rehearsin' with my peoples how to G 'em,1
From a remote location in the BM,0
"Scopin' the whole situation, like, ""Damn!""",0
"Metamorphic, as the dope turns to cream",0
But one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean,1
It's difficult to read 'em,1
"The windows to his soul were half closed, I put the key in",1
"Pulled off slow, hopin' my people fleein'",0
Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in,0
Coppers was watchin' us through nighttime binoculars,0
"This time they got us on tape, exchangin' dope for dollars",0
Make me wanna holler back at the crib in the sauna,1
Prayin' my people bailed out,0
like Time/Warner,1
"Awaitin' a call, from his kin, not the coroner",0
"Phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner",0
"Beads of sweat, second thoughts on my mind",0
How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets?,0
"(This time, stress, givin' this shit up, fuck)",0
[Chorus 1],0
This is the number one rule for your set,1
"In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets",1
"On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget",1
"In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets",1
This is the number one rule for your set,1
"In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets",1
"If through our travels we get separated, never forget",1
"In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets",1
[Verse 2],0
"As sure as this Earth is turnin', souls burnin'",1
In search of higher learnin',1
"Turnin' in every direction, seekin' direction",0
"My mom's cryin', because her insides are dyin'",0
"Her son tryin' her patience, keep her heart racin'",0
"A million beats a minute, I know I push you to your limit",0
"But it's this game Love, I'm caught up all in it",0
"They make it, so you can't prevent it, never give it",0
"You gotta take it, can't fake it, I keep it authentic",0
My hand got this pistol shakin',1
'Cause I sense danger like Camp Crystal Lake and,1
Don't wanna shoot him,1
", but I got him",0
"Trapped, within this infrared dot",0
About to hot him and hit rock bottom,0
"No answers to these trick questions, no time, shit's stressin'",0
My life found I got to live for the right now,0
"Time waits for no man, can't turn back the hands",1
"Once it's too late, gotta learn to live with regrets",1
[Chorus 2],0
"You used to hold me, told me that I was the best",1
Anything in this world I want I could possess,1
All that made me want is all that I could get,1
"In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets",1
(When I was young) you used to hold me,1
Told me that I was the best,1
Anything in this world I want I could possess,1
All that made me want is all that I could get,1
"In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets",1
[Verse 3],1
"I found myself reminiscin', remember this one?",0
"When he was here he was crazy nice with his, son",0
"I miss him, long as I'm livin' he's livin' through memories",1
He's there to kill all my suicidal tendencies,1
"In heaven lookin' over me, or in hell keepin' it cozy",0
"I'm comin', life on these streets ain't what it's supposed to be",0
"Remember Newton, mutual friend?",0
"Well, me and him feudin', on your life I tried to talk to him",0
"But you know niggas, think they guns can stop four niggas",0
Frontin' like they're Big Willie but really owe niggas,1
"Hoe niggas, this year I'll show niggas â€” think I'm slippin'?",0
"I'm about to send you a roommate, no bullshittin'",0
But my hustle's goin' too well to hit him,0
"You was right, niggas want you to be miserable with them",0
"Anyway, I ain't tryin' to hear it, I think I'm touched",1
This whole verse I been talkin' to your spirit a little too much,0
[Chorus 1],0
This is the number one rule for your set,1
"In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets",1
"On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget",1
"In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets",1
This is the number one rule for your set,1
"In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets",1
"If through our travels we get separated, never forget",1
"In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets",1
