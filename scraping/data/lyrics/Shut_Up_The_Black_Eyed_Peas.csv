[Chorus: Fergie],0
We try to take it slow,0
But we're still losin' control,0

"Girl, me and you were just fine, you know",0
We wine and dine,0
Did them things that couples do when in love (You know),0
Walks on the beach and stuff (You know),0
Things that lovers say and do,0
"I love you boo,",0
I love you too,0
"I miss you a lot,",0
I miss you even more,0
That's why I flew you out when we was on tour,0
But then something got outta hand,0
You start yellin' when I'm with my friends,0
Even though I had legitimate reasons,0
(Bullshit),0
You know I have to make them dividends,0
(Bullshit),0
"How could you trust your private eyes, girl?",0
"That's why you don't believe my lies, and quick to say",0

[Verse 2: Taboo],0
Why does emotion gotta move so fast?,0
Love is progress if you could make it last,0
Why is it that you just lose control?,0
Every time you agree on takin' it slow,0
So why does it got to be so damn tough?,1
'Cause fools in lust could never get enough of love,0
Showin' him the love that you be givin',0
Changing up your livin' for a lovin' transition,0
"Girl, it's a mission tryin' to get you to listen",0
We mad at each other has become our tradition,0
"You yell, I yell, everybody yells",0
Got neighbors across the street sayin',0
"""Who the hell?!""",0
Who the hell?,0
What the hell's goin' down?,0
Too much of the bickering,0
Kill it with the sound and...,0
[Chorus: Fergie & (will.i.am)],0
"Shut up, just shut up, shut up",0
"Shut it up, just shut up, shut up",0
We try to take it slow,0
But we're still losin' control,0
And we try to make it work,0
But it still ends up the worst,0
And I'm crazy (For what?),0
(Crazy for what?) For tryin' to be your lady (Oh yeah),0
I think I'm goin' crazy,0

"Girl, our love is dying",0
Why did you stop tryin',0
"I never been a quitah
But I do deserve betta",0
Believe me I will do bad,0
Let's forget the past and let's start this new plan,0
"Why? 'Cause it's the same old routine
And then next week I hear them scream",0
"Girl, I know you're tired of the things they say",0
"You're damn right
'Cause I heard them lame dame excuses just yesterday",0
That was a different thing,0
"No, it ain't
That was a different thing
No, it ain't
That was a different thing
It was the same damn thing
Same ass excuses
Boy you're useless
Woah, oh!!",0
