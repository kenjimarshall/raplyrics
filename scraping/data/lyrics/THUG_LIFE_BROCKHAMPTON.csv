[Verse 2: Dom McLennon],0
It's different reconciling with skeletons I ain't know I possessed,1
I sought perfection out in ways I no longer accept,1
I understand what I neglect in times when I obsess,1
"I’m learning to confess, this fate is harder to digest",1
The biggest threat I’m up against is who I face in my reflection,1
Depression still an uninvited guest I'm always accepting,1
Can’t help but meet the feeling with a familiar embrace,1
When I know that it’ll kill me if I give into my brain,1
"I see the shadows inside, they ten feet tall with no eyes",1
They put my head in the water and it’s so beautiful under,1
"The sun reflecting off the corals, colors I can’t describe",1
To make the darkness divine,1
