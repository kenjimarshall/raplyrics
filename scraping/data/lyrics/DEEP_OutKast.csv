"Greetings, earthlings. Take me to your leader (ooh shit!)",1
[Hook],0
"D.E.E.P. you want to go D.E.E.P., I'll take ya D.E.E.P",0
You know you fucked up when you let my mind creep,0
Deeper than the page of a book let me look,1
"You let me hit the stage, that's when I got my folks hooked like...",0
[Verse 1: André 3000],0
Deeper than deep dish,1
",",0
hammers and vogues,1
Deeper than sea fish in the O(cean),1
"I got my gun on standby, like Coast Guards",1
"You boast hard, you'll get your salty ass crumbled like erb, word (hey man)",1
You heard it here first with your master plan in reverse,1
"I ain't the one with the curse, so disperse, yes, catching plagues",1
"Niggas catching AIDS, niggas getting sprayed, niggas on they way",1
"To a dead end, you won't catch me spreading no white thighs",1
I only see afro bitches up in my eyes,1
I don't eat no beef and surely not no pork,1
"I used to drink that 8, but now I shove it down your throat",1
"Quote, 'If they kill they own folks, what you think they gonna do to you?'",1
I'm Outkasted and claiming true,1
Aiming two at your muthafucking spine,1
"No, I make that three cause I don't wanna hear you whine",1
"Swine, got my folks blind, like Stevie",1
"Me be, wondering when I'm gonna see the end",0
Andre Ben' slamming backs like King acts,1
Over Organized tracks full of facts,1
So you know that it's D.E.E.P,0
[Hook],0
[Verse 2: Big Boi],0
"Well, you want me to get D.E.E.P., well then, I will",0
What? What will happen if you shoot that nigga and don't kill,0
He will come back and return like Lalah Hathaway,0
"Aiming for your skull, yeah I'm flexing on you that a way",0
"So if you pulling a tool, nigga you better use it",1
"Cause if you're threatening my life, better believe I'll be a fool with it",1
I don't take no shit from nobody,1
I gots the Goodie Mo crew right beside of me,1
"Damn, no pain, no gain, so I'mma hurt you",1
Breaking knees and elbows like I used to break my curfew,1
My mama used to tell me if a nigga ever hit me,0
Just to pick up the closest thing and knock the living shit out of he,0
"So if you run up, you get done up, I'mma end it",1
"Throw the gun up out the window, see the corner that I bent it",1
It's just so simple how we get so D.E.E.P,0
"Learn a lesson, pick up the album when it hits the streets like...",0
[Hook],0
[Verse 3: André 3000],1
"No, I ain't never been pimped by the system",1
That's because I ain't no slave,1
Don't be trying to sunbathe,1
",",0
never lived off in no cave,1
Bloody old chap and in this head of mine is full of naps,1
And the only thing I know is how to fuck and how to rap,1
Y'all think I'm stupid cause I shoots 'em up like cupid,1
"And if you gave me a basketball, I'll show you how to shoot it",1
My head's polluted cause I'm zooted,1
", bobbin to the bottom",0
"If a pair of Jordan's came out, y'all figure that I got 'em",1
But no I don't because I don't be having funds,1
The gold that I am wearing is really made out of bronze,1
It weighs a ton and making my neck turn green,1
And I got a criminal record that will never come clean,1
"Oh, and it seems that I make babies like a rabbit",1
And then never taking care of them has just become a habit,1
I grab my tablet and get busy with the pen,0
Y'all could not be just like me if y'all was my twin,1
So you get mad and try to make me inferior,0
"You pissing me off, I'm in that ass like interior",0
"Oh, step in my Cadillac, let's ride through the hood",1
"Eh, why don't you roll that window down so you can see it real good",1
And take a look at all the pimps and all the pushers and the players,1
"That's living on a whim, thin ice and a prayer",1
"Oh and mayor, can I gets a little backup",1
Please don't let them Dixie muthafuckas put that flag up,1
But let me shut up cause they say we equal,1
Whenever the fuck our record comes out in 1994,1
"Yeah, yes sir, it's like that",0
"Gonna take y'all deep, so go back",0
[Hook],0
[Verse 4: Big Boi],0
I'm getting deeper than that prostitutes vagina,0
And pimping way mo' hoes than there's peoples out in China,1
I roll that black Lac with the crust velvet interior,0
"Niggas try to bite that shit, but their shit is inferior",0
We rolling thick like the Pillsbury Doughboy,1
"And I don't give a damn, muthafucka cause you know why",1
The Caucus Mountains and the mutant gene,1
You try to wipe a nigga like me slam up off the scene,1
"You hairy bastard, work a little bit faster",0
"Because of the shit that I done been through, I shall never call you master",1
"You D-E-V-I-L, the cave is where you dwell",1
"So stay up out the rain, it's beginning to smell like dog, yeah",1
I wonder how you would be acting if youse in my shoes,0
You'd probably shit your tight ass draws cause I got a short ass fuse,0
So what do you really wanna do when I get militant,1
"Thought I was a pimp, flip the script if you can' get with this",0
"They call me Big Boi, I be capping with a big gun",0
"Run up on it if you want it, then you bite the big one, yeah",0
