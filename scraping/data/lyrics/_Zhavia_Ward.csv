[Intro],0
Hit-Boy,0
Uh,0
[Verse 1],0
I grew up in Norwalk,1
Hanging by the donut shop,1
Didn't have a car,1
So we used to have to walk the block,1
"I was only six years old, I was running",1
Cold bare feet when the storm started coming,1
Mama worked two jobs,1
Couldn't keep the fridge stocked,1
Used to eat popcorn for dinner with the soda pop,1
"Moved out one too many times, couldn't count it",1
"Always keep it real, no doubtin'",0
[Pre-Chorus],0
Young girl you better go fast,1
This world ain't gonna hold back,1
"You know you gotta own your life, uh",1
[Chorus],0
And I saw in my dreams,1
I knew I'd be 17,1
Watchin' reality spinnin' around,1
And I saw it in my dreams,1
I knew life would change for me,1
This is reality,1
Look at me now,1
[Verse 2],0
Had to let the house go,1
Didn't let me say no,1
Mama had to quit her job,1
Just so I could make the show,1
"Thought it was a big break, still no breakin'",1
"Gave me seven G's and a deal, didn't take it",1
"Days in the motel, nights in the studio",1
Spendin' every penny prayin' God don't let us go broke,1
"FashionNova got us in a house, L.A living (Ayy)",1
"Got my own bed now, it's been a minute",1
[Pre-Chorus],0
Young girl you better go fast,0
This world ain't gonna hold back,0
"You know you gotta own your life, uh",0
[Chorus],0
And I saw in my dreams,0
I knew I'd be 17,0
Watchin' reality spinnin' around (Spinnin' around),0
And I saw it in my dreams,0
I knew life would change for me,0
This is reality,0
Look at me now (Look at me now),0
[Bridge],0
I used to dream (Used to dream),1
I used to dream about it,1
I knew that I would make it out,1
Ain't what it seems (What it seems),1
That's why I never doubt it,1
I know I'm gonna make it out,1
[Chorus],0
And I saw in my dreams,0
I knew I'd be 17,0
Watchin' reality spinnin' around,0
And I saw it in my dreams,0
I knew life would change for me,0
This is reality,0
Look at me now,0
