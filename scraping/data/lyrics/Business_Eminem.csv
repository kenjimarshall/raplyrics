Marshall! Sounds like an SOS,1
"Holy wack unlyrical lyrics, Andre, you're fucking right!",1
To the Rapmobileâ€”let's go!,1
(Marshall! Marshall!),1
Bitches and gentlemen! It's showtime!,1
"Hurry hurry, step right up!",0
Introducing the star of our show,0
His name is,0
(Marshall!),1
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now,1
"So without further ado, I bring to you",0
(Marshall!),1
[Verse 1: Eminem],0
You're 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest,1
"Most rawest form,",1
flow almost flawless,0
"Most hardest, most honest known artist",1
"Chip off the old block, but old Doc is (back)",1
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin,1
"Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden",1
"With his own private plane, his own pilot",1
Set to blow college dorm rooms doors,1
off the hinges,1
"Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes",1
"Vrinn, vrinn!",1
"Yeah, here I come, I'm inches",0
"Away from you, dear, fear none",0
"Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1, so",1

Let's get down to business,0
"I don't got no time to play around, what is this?",0
"Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down",1
On these clowns; can I get a witness?,1
(Hell yeah!),1

[Verse 2: Eminem],0
"Quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles",0
"Gee willikers Dre,",0
"""Holy bat syllables!""",1
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham,1
"When I'm gone, time to get rid of these rap criminals",0
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best,0
"You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it",0
"Flow's too wet, nobody close to it",0
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit,0
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on,1
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much,1
"They make it all up, there's no such thing",1
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans,1
It just means so much more to so much more,0
People when you're rappin' and you know what for,0
The show must go on;,0
so I'd like to welcome y'all,1
"To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!",1

"It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo",0
"Two old friends, why panic? You already know",0
"Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes",1
"Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero",1
"You can even call collect,",1
the most feared duet,1
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette,1
And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat,0
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set,0
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely,0
Ease over these beats and be so breezy,0
"Jesus, how can shit be so easy?",0
How can one Chandra be so Levy?,1
"Turn on these beats, MCs don't see me",1
"Believe me, BET and MTV",0
"Are gonna grieve when we leave,",0
"dog, fo' sheezy",1
"Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me",1
"'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear",1
"Into the mountains,",1

[Outro: Eminem],0
"So there you have it, folks",0
(Marshall!) has come to save the day,0
Back with his friend Andre,0
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay,1
Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay,0
And never go away,0
Until our dying day,0
Until we're old and grey (Marshall!),0
"So until next time, friends",1
"Same blonde hair, same rap channel",1
"Good night, everyone!",0
Thank you for coming! Your host for the evening (Marshall!),0
Oh! Heh,0
