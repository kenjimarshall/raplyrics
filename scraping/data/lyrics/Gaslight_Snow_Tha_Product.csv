[Intro],0
Look,0
Pum-Pumbaa are you nuts?,0
Mmm,0
[Verse 1],0
Oh you a big money spendin',0
Man who gets the women,0
Big bill droppin',0
"Want it, then you got it",0
Rollie face wearin',0
"If she lookin', then she starin'",0
"If she starin', then she carin'",0
But can't put a finger on it,0
"You a big game talker, every ex's your stalker",0
"You ain't ready for no relationship, but can talk to her",0
You just want some company,0
Every bitch you fuck with either crazy or amazing,0
Then you shady as can fuckin' be,0
You can't commit and that's your greatest talent,0
Claim you're breaking hearts like back to back,0
Deep inside there's somethin' less than average,0
'Bout the bitches that you claim to bag,0
Somethin' 'bout the bracket that you at,0
Maybe all the practice that you have,0
Wouldn't do you any good where I'm at,0
Class ain't somethin' you can pay to have,0
[Pre-Chorus],0
Gaslight pro (pro),0
Gaslight pro (pro),0
[Chorus],0
And you could tell me lies,0
"Tell me, tell me lies",0
Tell me I'm trippin',0
"Tell me why, tell me I'm the one",0
Then rewind to a gaslight pro (pro),0
[Verse 2],0
Oh you a fuckin' Prince Charming out in public,0
"I'm like ""Yeah, yeah, yeah""",0
"Lead me on, then they leave",0
Then it's back to never there,0
Throw the blame out everywhere,0
"""No one can compare"" yeah, yeah",0
"You just never wrong, but here's your problem",0
"Now, I don't care",0
"You playin' with my mind, somehow everytime",0
"Pretty lies come right out your mouth, and that ain't right",0
Gotta fuckin' draw the line,0
I've been just your type,0
Prey on any insecurity you fucking find,0
Got me questionin' my memory,0
"Your narcissist attempts at e-ither startin' off the problems, causin' drama",1
Then you got me second guessin' me,0
And I don't give a fuck which house your Moon is,0
What sign you are or how you grew up,0
You're a fuckin' adult and you got to get it together,0
"You're a dick and you're manipulative as fuck, ugh",0
[Pre-Chorus],0
Gaslight pro (pro),0
Gaslight pro (pro),0
[Chorus],0
And you could tell me lies,0
"Tell me, tell me lies",0
Tell me I'm trippin',0
"Tell me why, tell me I'm the one",0
Then rewind to a gaslight pro (pro),0
[Pre-Chorus],0
Gaslight pro (pro),0
Gaslight pro (pro),0
[Chorus],0
And you could tell me lies,0
"Tell me, tell me lies",0
Tell me I'm trippin',0
"Tell me why, tell me I'm the one",0
Then rewind to a gaslight pro (pro),0
(And you could tell me),0
And you could tell me lies,0
"Tell me, tell me lies",0
Tell me I'm trippin',0
"Tell me why, tell me I'm the one",0
Then rewind to a gaslight pro (pro),0
