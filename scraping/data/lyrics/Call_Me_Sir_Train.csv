[Chorus: Pat Monahan],0
When I ride by myself,0
I don't ever get no help,0
But when I roll up with her,0
Everybody calls me sir,0
No matter how long I stay,0
They never ever know my name,0
But when I walk in with her,0
Everybody calls me sir,0
[Verse 1: Pat Monahan],0
"Northern California, same old Friday night",1
I tend to be invisible underneath these city lights,1
"Then I met my baby, felt like I struck gold",1
Now they treat me like royalty everywhere I go,1
"Oh, oh, oh, oh",0

[Verse 2: Cam],0
I ain't goin' nowhere unless he's there with me,0
"'Cause I don't stand in line no more, admissions always free",0
"He could break the law, he could break your heart in two",0
But I promise that you won't care when he smiles at you,0
"Oh, oh, oh, oh",0

[Verse 3: Travie McCoy],0
Every time we hit the streets it's like a world premier,0
She makes me feel like Sia swinging from that chandelier,0
Went from marginally famous to the top of the A-list,0
"And just for future reference, here's a tip Mr. Belvedere",0
Never judge a book by it's cover,0
And never judge an ugly duckling by his mother,0
"The frog prince got kissed, her lips granted his wish",0
"Itâ€™s a sad world when your net worth determines your lover, but",0
"What would I ever do without you, huh?",0
I prolly wouldn't have a clue without you,0
But one things for sure when I pull up with her,0
"Don't refer to me as Travie, you can",0
[Outro: Pat Monahan],0
You can call me sir,0
What would I ever do without you?,0
What would I ever do without you?,0
Call me sir,0
What would I ever do without you?,0
Call me sir,0
What would I ever do without you?,0
What would I ever do without you?,0
Call me sir,0
What would I ever do without you?,0
Call me sir,0
