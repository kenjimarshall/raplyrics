Drowning in the gray cell,1
To dwell in earthly hell,1
A pimp warrior fell,1
One-two! Sir Lucious L. Left Foot in the motherfuckin' booth!,1
Lucious! Sir Lucious!,1
"Sir Lucious Left Foot, has just entered",1

Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done,1

[Verse 1 - Big Boi],0
First rule in this thang: never let 'em see you sweat,1
Never let 'em be a threat,1
"And your feelings you must protect 'em, as well as your rectum",1
"Must keep self out of harm, out of danger's way",0
Let strangers play while you graduate and move on,1
True happiness is not acquired and you won't find it for sale,1
Unless you're in jail and trying to get a bail,0
Bondsman to go on and post that bail,0
You would be happy as hell,1
You thought you was happy until that court date came,1
Couldn't abort that case,1
"Nobody to take your place, family members at stake",0
Too late to escape and get on the run,0

[Verse 2],0
Once upon a rhyme one time when I was a child,1
(Flip that smile upside down now!),1
When I found out that Santa Claus was nothing more than Vanilli,1
"It was silly, 'cause my mom and pop, they worked for every penny",1
"Didn't have many but had enough to get by, enough to get fly",1
Only to start the New Year off in debt,1
Now you forget your happiness came and went like mom and dad's relationship,1
"Take a trip, you bring potato chips, I'll bring the hot sauce!",1

"1979, Dirty South, local lounge",0
(Flip that smile upside down now!),0
I never thought that alcohol could ease the notion of the sadness,0
Now what done used to be a happy home done turned into some bad shit,0
"Graphic, language, mild violence and the silence of the the fams",1
No members to remember but I know just who I am,0
I've grown into a man and like my nigga said,0
We executed the game plan 'cause we got that hot sauce,0
