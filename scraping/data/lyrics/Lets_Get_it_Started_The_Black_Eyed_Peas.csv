"In this context, there's no disrespect",0
"So when I bust my rhyme, you break ya necks",1
We got five minutes for us to disconnect,0
From all intellect and let the rhythm effect,0
To lose your inhibition follow your intuition,0
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition,0
"'Cause when we be out, girlies pull they weave out",0
You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out,0
"Burnin' 'til it's burned out, turn it 'til it's turned out",0

"Don't move too fast, people, just take it slow",0
"Don't get ahead, just jump into it",0
"Y'all hear about it, the Peas will do it",0
"Get started, get stupid",0
"Don't worry about it, people will walk you through it",0
Step by step like you're into New Kid,1
Inch by inch with the new solution,0
Transmit hits with no delusion,0
The feeling's irresistible and that's how we move it,0

"Lose your mind, this is the time",0
"Y'all can't stand still, trust and bang your spine (just)",0
"Bob your head like me, apl.de",1
Up inside the club or in your Bentley,0
