[Intro: Jay-Z],0
"Uh, uh uh uh",0
It's big pimpin' baby (that's right),0
"It's big pimpin', spendin' G's",0
"Feel me uh-huh uhh, uh-huh",0
"Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah",0
"Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah",0
[Verse 1: Jay Z],0
"You know I thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em",1
â€˜Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em,1
"Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin' good",1
But I don't fuckin' feed 'em,1
First time they fuss I'm breezin',0
"Talkin' about, ""What's the reasons?""",1
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word,1
"Bitch, better trust and believe 'em",1
In the cut where I keep 'em,1
"'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts",1
"Then it's ""beep beep"" and I'm pickin' them up",1
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck,1
Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs,1
Divorce him and split his bucks,1
Just because you got good head,1
"I'ma break bread, so you can be livin' it up?",1
"Shit, I part with nothin', y'all be frontin'",0
Me give my heart to a woman?,0
"Not for nothin', never happen;",0
I'll be forever mackin',1
"Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion",1
I got no patience and I hate waitin',1
"Ho, get your ass in and let's ride!",1
[Chorus: Jay Z],1
"We doin' big pimpin', we spendin' cheese",1
"Check 'em out now, big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.'s",1
We doin' big pimpin' up in N.Y.C,1
"It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B",1
[Verse 2: Bun B],1
"Nigga, it's the big Southern rap impresario",0
Comin' straight up out the black barrio,1
Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho,0
Then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o,0
"Oops, my bad, that's ""my scenario""",1
"No, I can't fuck a scary ho",0
"Now every time, every place, everywhere we go",0
"Hoes start pointin', they say: ""There he go!""",0
Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo',0
Heat than a little bit,0
We don't pull it out over little shit,0
And if you catch a lick when I spit,1
Then it won't be a little hit,0
"Go read a book, you illiterate son of a bitch!",0
And step up your vocab!,0
Don't be surprised if your ho stab out with me,1
And you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB,1
"Livin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it",0
But nigga if you hatin' I,0
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked,0
Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh,1
Wet with two pairs of clothes on,1
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin' to the track,1
"Timbaland, let me spit my prose on",1
Pump it up in the pro-zone,1
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on,1
Ain't the track that we flows on,1
But when shit get hot then the Glock start poppin' like ozone,1
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man,1
"For real, it don't get no bigger, man",0
"Don't trip, let's flip, gettin' throwed on the flip",0
"Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool!",0
[Chorus 2: Bun B],1
"We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese",1
We be big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.'s,1
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T,1
"It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B",1
[Verse 3: Pimp C],1
"Smokin' out, pourin' up",0
Keepin' lean up in my cup,0
All my car got leather and wood,1
"In my hood we call it ""buck""",1
Everybody wanna ball,1
Holla at broads at the mall,1
"If he up, watch him fall",0
"Nigga, I can't fuck with y'all",0
"If I wasn't rappin', baby",0
I would still be ridin' Mercedes,1
Comin' down and sippin' daily,1
No record 'til whitey pay me,1
"Uhhh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys?",0
Comin' down in candied toys,0
Smokin' weed and talkin' noise,0
[Chorus 2: Bun B],1
"We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese",1
We be big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.'s,1
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T,1
"It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B",1
[Verse 4: Jay-Z],1
"On the canopy, my stamina be",1
Enough for Pamela Anderson Lee,1
MTV jam of the week,1
"Made my money quick, then back to the streets",0
"But still sittin' on blades, sippin' that Ray",0
"Standin' on the corner of my block, hustlin'",1
Still gettin' that 'caine,1
Half what I paid slippin' right through customs,1
"It'll sell by night, its egg shell white",1
"I got so many grams, if the man find out",1
It will land me in jail for life,1
"But I'm still big pimpin', spendin' cheese",0
"With Bun B, Pimp C, and Timothy",0
We got bitches in the back of the truck,0
"Laughin' it up, Jigga Man: that's what's up!",0
[Chorus 2: Bun B],1
"We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese",1
We be big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.'s,1
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T,1
"It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B",1
