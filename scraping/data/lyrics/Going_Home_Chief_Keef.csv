[Chorus],0
I was busy slidin' in the 918 (skrrt),0
Baby momma text me at 5:18 (yah),0
Bad bitch text me at 6:16 (bitch),0
'Bout 7 A.M. she was neckin' me,0
Why she send these kissy face emojis to my phone? (huh?),0
She diggin' hard on a nigga 'cause I'm goin' strong,0
She don't wanna smoke because what I smoke is strong,0
"I'm in it all night, don't know when she goin' home",0
[Verse 1],0
She gon' slob on my knob like a corn on the cob,0
"But we can't go out in public, there's paparazzi to dodge",0
"As I'm droppin' the top, told her shoot for the stars",0
I know she gon' love me because every woman does,1
As I slide in that water she get wet like a slide,0
"No I cannot stop her, she gon' go like a ride",0
"Keep that thing clean, it be smellin' like some Tide",0
But no I cannot wife her so it's lookin' like divide,0
She noticed me in the strip club throwin' racks,0
"It was me and the gang, we was lookin' like a tribe",0
When she came to the crib it was lookin' like a vibe,0
Shawty got that head on her that I can't describe,0
[Chorus],0

Baby momma text me at 5:18 (yah),0
Bad bitch text me at 6:16 (bitch),0
'Bout 7 A.M. she was lickin' me,0
Why she send these kissy face emojis to my phone? (huh?),0
She diggin' hard on a nigga 'cause I'm goin' strong,0
She don't wanna smoke because what I smoke is strong,0
"I'm in it all night, don't know when she goin' home",0
[Verse 2],0
"Shawty gettin' free feels, put her hands on my wheel",0
"But I can't really trust her, got my hands on the steel (bang)",0
"I go in for the kill, rollin' like a ferris wheel",0
"She get wetter than a ship, shawty got that Navy Seal",0
"She was talkin' all tough, but I got her walkin' stiff",0
"We had a bet that if I hit it good, she would make me meals",1
You would think it's homicide how I hit her with the steel,0
"All this energy it took, I should hit her with a bill",0
She really want it all so I hit her with a lil',0
"Yeah she say she want some more, say that's all I got to give",0
"No relationship, a friend zone is all I got to build",1
"When it come to catchin' bodies, girl I got a lot of kills",0
