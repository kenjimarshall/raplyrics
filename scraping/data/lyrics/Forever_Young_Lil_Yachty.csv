[Verse 1],0
All night I've been watching you,0
"So tonight, you're leaving with me",0
I've been waiting my whole life to give you it all,0
"It's on now, it's on now",0
I'm talking the big fancy lights,0
The star studded nights with me,0
We forever young,0
We forever young,0
We forever young,0
[Pre-Chorus],0
The music's loud and I'm feeling wild,0
Come dance along with the golden child,1
"I don't know much but sure, let me check your fouls",0
Two technicals but you beautiful,0
You grew up 6 brothers in a cubicle,1
And they all bustin' for ya if I make the wrong move,1
If I break your heart then I'm a dumb dude,0
You get what you give and I'm the one who loses,0
[Chorus],0
But we could be together forever,0
But we could be together forever and ever,0
I wanna live life with you forever and ever,0
Together,0
Forever young,0
Forever young,0
We forever young,0
[Verse 2],0
Shining bright under the shining sun,0
Like moonshine you keep it 99% with me,0
I'm feeling all your energy,0
I know you love to vibe with me,0
I know you love to ride for me,0
"Your favorite thing to say is, ""Boat, I love when you're inside of me""",0
Your love is like a high to me,0
I love to go out my way to make sure you stay happy,0
We forever young,0
[Pre-Chorus],0
The music's loud and I'm feeling wild,0
Come dance along with the golden child,1

You grew up 6 brothers in a cubicle,1
And they all bustin' for ya if I make the wrong move,1
If I break your heart then I'm a dumb dude,0
You get what you give and I'm the one who loses,0
[Chorus],0
But we could be together forever,0
But we could be together forever and ever,0
I wanna live life with you forever and ever,0
