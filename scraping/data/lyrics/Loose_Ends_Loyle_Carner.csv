[Chorus: Jorja Smith &,0
Loyle Carner,0
],0
"In love, when the going is tough",0
I wait 'til it falls on deaf ears,0
"Hearsay, without the boundaries of love",0
"My take is, I wish there was a better way",0
"Uh, I got a lot of love, a lot of loose ends",0
(Way),0
A lot of people that I wish I knew then,0
(Way),0
Friends beckon every second you spend,0
(Way),0
"I'm wettin' the pen, every letter you send
Uh, I got a lot of love, a lot of loose ends",0
(Way),0
A lot of people that I wish I knew then,0
(Way),0
Friends beckon every second you spend,0
(Way),0
"I'm wettin' the pen, every letter you send",0
[Verse 1: Loyle Carner],0
"Yo, I been listening to Dreamy Days,",1
I'm in disarray,0
I realise it's everybody else who's still astray,0
"I feel ashamed, I know there ain't no savin' away",0
"They went astray, I went Australia",0
So what I'm supposed to say to 'em?,0
"Uh, when all this love's out of range",0
"Everything around me changed, I'm supposed to stay the same",0
Turn down these free drinks I couldn't even name,0
"And I like all this money, 'cause I'm fuckin' up my brain",0
"I been goin' insane, shelf full of family remains",0
Brokenhearted is seein' none of them again,0
"I, I pour the glass, stick my head out in the rain",0
Try and find another person I can blame,0
"Sat upon this plane, uh",0
"And yo, I'm prayin' that we don't crash",0
"'Cause every night, I shiver at the sight when we go back",0
"'Cause every night could be my last, and yeah, I know that",0
"So I crack a smile 'fore it goes black, trust",0

[Verse 2: Loyle Carne],0
"Trust, uh, I wish you'd been there when my dad had died",0
"Uh, I wish you'd been there when my mother cried",0
"I, I wish you'd been there in the drag of night",0
"To see my side, look me in my eyes when I was paralysed",0
And tell me everything's alright and push it to the side,0
"It's just a sacrifice, at times, I told a bag of lies",0
"But not a pack of lies, we always told a couple ones",0
"Of course it was true, you only knew me from the dramatise",0
"I feel an agonising risk, 'cause in a thousand islands",0
This is where I really wanna be when we were cracking wise,0
"'Cause it was black and white, literally black and white",0
White from my mother and my father was the blackest skies,0
"Skies, I, I can see it's true",0
"I, I see my mother up in you",0
"Shit, I think my dad'd see it too",0
"Yo, I just wish he knew, uh",0

[Verse 3: Loyle Carne],0
"Uh, imagine all the friends you see most",0
Each one you peggin' away,0
"Is dependin' on you puttin' pen to the page, uh",0
"And so, you break it down, checking they're paid",0
"Another day you're heartbreakin', you resented the stage",0
You feel that same rage,0
"Watch the crowd, watch the stage thinkin', ""Shit""",0
Rather in the crowd with your mates drinkin',0
"Misbehaviours, catch another dame winkin'",0
"You feel ashamed, guzzle Jagers, your brain's sinkin'",0
"You think it's deep, don't think it's depression",0
A misspent adolescence,0
"But all this time, all this time, time's of the essence",0
You would never learn from your lessons,0
You're stuck in that same quintessence,0
"Heartbreak, one in the same",0
"Days change, but you're stuck in the game",0
"It's like, she's tellin' you you're young enough to be at uni",0
"Somehow, the one who sees through me",0
