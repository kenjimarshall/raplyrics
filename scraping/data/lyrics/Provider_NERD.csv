[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams],0
"Woke up, I had the same clothes on I had on last night",0
I must have passed out,0
And cash is just like the clothes I worn yesterday,0
"We are broke,",0
I gotta get my ass out,1
I went to see what my friend was talking about,1
He told me cocaine could get you clout,1
My momma said he's trouble and school's my route,0
But I went to high school and got kicked out,0
So I'm driving this truck down 95,0
I pray to God I make it home alive,0
I don't get pulled over by the man,0
I just want to make it home to hold your hand,0
[Hook],0
"Goodbye, beloved one",0
Do you know what I am?,0
If you don't see my face no more,0
"I'm a provider, girl, gotta face the streets tonight",0
"Goodbye, beloved one",0
Do you know what I am?,0
If you don't see my face no more,0
"I'm a rider, girl, gotta face the streets tonight",0
[Verse 2],0
"You say you don't want me to go, but I have to",0
"Please, don't weep, I love you",0
I refuse to be a bum,0
Especially coming where I'm from,0
"I'm a provider, girl, and I love you",0
So it's just like I said before,0
"Heading down 95, dodging Johnny law",0
"I don't need a ticket, though I never got one",0
"If he pulls me over, he gon' feel my shotgun",1
"I think about life, pull down my hat",0
"It's just like this road, I don't know where I'm at",0
I don't want to be another cocaine story,0
Will I find my sanity where I find my glory,0
Come on,0

"Goodbye, beloved one",0
Do you know what I am?,0
If you don't see my face no more,0
"I'm a provider, girl, gotta face the streets tonight",0
"Goodbye, beloved one",0
Do you know what I am?,0
If you don't see my face no more,0

[Bridge],0
"Someday, this will be over",0
We'll raise a family,0
"I'll get a job, and I'll be a voter",1
"And if I die, it will change you",0
I'll watch over our family,0
But only as an angel,0
So don't tell me you don't know what you see,0
When you're looking at a motherfucker just like me,0
"I'm a provider, girl",0
"I said, don't tell me you don't know what you see",0
When you're looking at a motherfucker just like me,0
"I'm a rider, girl",0

[Outro],0
"I love you, girl",0
I'm doing this for us,0
I don't know any better,0
What am I supposed to do?,0
Nothing?,0
I love you,0
