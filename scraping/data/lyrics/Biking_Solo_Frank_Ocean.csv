"And I walk in my sleep, I can't help that (I can't)",1
When's the last time I asked for some help that,1
"I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?",1
I couldn't get from nobody out there (I can't),1
When's the last time I asked for some help that,1
"I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?",1
Nobody,1

I don't get weak in the knees,1
Hundreds spread out like a fan,1
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals,1
"Open the sky, get a handful",0
Torso marked up like a vandal,1
How you not fuckin' with cash?,1
God gave you what you could handle,1

"Bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' slow-mo",0
Maybe the four wheel excitin' us mo',0
I'm cold when the temperatures dip below 70s,1
How can I be burr around L.A. coast?,1
"The diamonds is plural, the Tiffany brooch",1
"On my lapel, at the table, I'm givin' a toast",1
The first wedding that I've been in my twenties,1
Thinkin' maybe someone is not somethin' to own,1
Maybe the government got nothin' to do with it,1
Thinkin' maybe the feeling just comes and it goes,1
Think I want me a lil' one that look like my clone,1
Me and my baby can't do on our own,1
"I landed a trick, got my impossibles",1
"I'm fuckin' with Addy, I'm watchin' my dose",1

"Since Ben Baller sold all his ice up at Slauson, ooh",1
I'm bikin' uphill and it's burnin' my quads (obstacles),1

Transition lightning (ascending),0
Ashes and remnants of ballers,0
Body that's gutted,0
A Bentley that used to be flawless,0
"I'm high up, the raindrops keep falling",0
"Scattered, the showers",0
Don't scaffold the towers,0
"I'm up, mom, I promise",0
In class with the honors,1
No cheat like I'm honest,1
And how did I become so accomplished?,1
'cause I don't see foes,1
I just see a code,1
I just see a hole,1
Chinks in your armor,1
Like Pac in the Hummer,1
Like Jigga in summer,1
Left the house like Obama,1
Hit the road like a runner,1
Hit the road like Road Runner,1
