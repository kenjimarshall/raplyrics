[Intro],0
Look,0
[Chorus],0
I grew up in Streatham,1
Teachers was givin' man tests,1
Same time the mandem were givin' out testers,1
I got peng tings givin' man stress,1
"I ain't gotta sex it, message or text it",1
I don't wanna do you and I,1
Like I'm in Leicester skippin' my lectures,1
We used to ride 'round all reckless,0
[Verse 1],0
"Stolen 'peds, that's Geely and Vespas",1
And the feds called my broski restless,0
"Said he got a charge in the car, no Tesla",1
And everybody 'round me rowdy,0
"I walk in, tell the jeweler, ""Wow me""",1
If you're talkin' 'bout P's just 'low me,1
"19, I put 19 on an Audi",1
I'll never forget that day that I found me the cutest caramel brownie,1
And the chest and back both bouncy,1
"Trust me, everyting shake, no Saudi",1
My G just came out for a shooting,1
"And Ramz done a madness, charting",1
Say that man got something in common,1
"'Cause trust me, both of their tings been barking",1
"If you see him at a drinkup, park him",0
"Do it like Jordan, run up and spark him",1
"My G's been on badness, way before they had a moustache like Stalin",1
"And this ting's all love and hate, 'cause a lot of man love to hate",1
My young G done draws and eights,1
Now he's cuttin' through bricks like the 1-1-8,1
"And I ain't on indirects, diss me, and I take that personal",0
How you gassed off a note that's purple?,1
Bet you never got it off white like Virgil,1
Two men and an angry Merc,1
"That's war wit' a German, Winston Churchill",1
It's mad when man wanna murk you,1
But you know you gotta be in by curfew,1
"And I seen a lot of man get pressured, why?",1
[Chorus],0
I grew up in Streatham,1
And teachers was givin' man tests,1
Same time mandem were givin' out testers,1
I got peng tings givin' man stress,0
"I ain't gotta sex it, message or text it",0
I don't wanna do you and I,1
Like I'm in Leicester skippin' my lectures,1
We used to roll 'round all stupid,0
[Verse 2],0
"Mitcham Lane, that's Streatham and Tooting",1
I'm in East tryna link my girl,1
"'Cause I've got a baby, a crossbow like Cupid",1
"Man are dead or in jail, that's useless",1
"Tell a yute, ""If you've got a brain, then use it""",1
Now I drive past man I went school with,1
"You was the cool kid, now you look clueless",1
"And I'm still tryna tell man, ""Fuck the Audi, switch it for a Benz""",1
When you're tryna make it out the ends,1
Friends of enemies are enemies,1
And enemies of enemies are friends,1
"Fuck the Benz, I switch it for a Beamer",1
"Tell the dealer, ""Need a bigger litre""",1
He told me he's on me when he sees me,1
I barely remember why we're beefin',1
[Chorus],0
But I grew up in Streatham,1
And teachers was givin' man tests,1
Same time mandem were givin' out testers,1
I've got peng tings givin' me stress,1
"Nudes in the message, put in an effort",1
But I don't need a me and you,1
Like when a chef would eat at his restaurant,1
