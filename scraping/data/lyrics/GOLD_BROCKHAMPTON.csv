Swan dive down the 405,1
Land at the bottom of El Toro High,1
With the precision of a cut from a Zorro knife,1
The boy spit like he made out of 409,1

We rock pink now on Wednesdays,1
Green looks good with your envy,1
Mix with white 'cause you salty but this stainless,0
I'm like platinum and it's painless,0
I just skip on the beat like I'm Pee-Wee Herman,1
Hands up for all my sermons,0
