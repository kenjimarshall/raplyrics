"Let's be honest, you stole that line 'bout bitches bein' your sons",1
How you take my '09 jail tweet and run?,1
Talkin' about bringin' knives to a fight with guns,1
When the only shot you ever took was in your buns,1
"And I saw Meek at All-Star, he told me your ass dropped",1
He couldn't fuck you for three months because your ass dropped,1
Now I don't think y'all understand how bad her ass got,1
The implants that she had put in her ass popped,1
"I was like, ""Damn, 90 days and you couldn't have box?",1
Did she at least compensate? Start givin' you mad top?,1
"Her name Minaj, right? She ain't throw you some bad thots?""",1
"He said ""Nah,"" that's when I knew you was really a trash bop",1
"You was screamin' ""Free Remy!"" when I was upstate doomed",1
But now that they freed Remy you don't sing the same tune,1
"Locked me up, threw away my keys, threw away my weaves",1
"Snatched me from my son, braids to the back, state greens",1
"Daily News, ""Her career's over,"" ""She was kinda stupid,""",1
But you saw a opportunity 'cause you a opportunist,1
Left your Day 1 'cause you heard he was on some cheat shit,1
Then got with the dude that told you on some creep shit,1
"But what happened to Omeeka? Nah, on some G shit",1
Left him and took a pic with the dude he had beef with?,1
And we all know it was a beef that you started,0
"Pillow-talkin' out of your ass, this bitch retarded",0
"Now you gotta die, you dearly departed",0
"Bloodbath when I catch you, a real red carpet",1
"Now what I'ma do, I'ma just stick to the facts",0
"Bitch so scared of my future, got this bitch goin' backwards",0
"Been through mad crews, you disloyal hoochie",1
Now all of a sudden you back with Drake and Tunechi?,1
"After he said you sucked his dick, you back with Gucci?",1
"Who next: Puff, Deb or Fendi? You a A-list groupie",1
"And to be the Queen of Rap, you gotta actually rap",1
The whole industry know that your shit is a wrap,1
"No, to be the Queen of Rap, you can't have a ghostwriter",1
And that's why this is my house; Flo Rida,1
"Niggas done seen Drake pennin', Wayne pennin'",1
"And since your first boyfriend left, bitch ain't winnin'",1
"You a Internet troll, a Web browser, I'm sorry",1
You can't get a on line without Safaree,1
"Mentionin' guns, you Pussy Galore, James Bond",1
Only time you touch a trigga is when you fucked Trey Songz,1
"Coke head, you cheated on your man with Ebro",1

"Tried to front in February, catch you in that Maybach",1
"Show you how to use your name, you be usin' your name wack",1
"I'm sayin', how you mix Nicki with a Minaj?",1
"I'ma park this bitch, put Nicki in the garage",1
"I'm gettin' money like Nicky Barnes, I'm the big homie",1
I responded in less than 48 Hours; Nick Nolte,1
"Gettin' close like Nick Jonas, grippin' the gauge",1
"Then blaze off, Face Off, bitch, Nicolas Cage",1
"You animated like Nickelodeon, you fake, bitch",1
Only the kids believe in you; you St. Nick,1

You only fronted on Mariah 'cause Mariah don't carry,1
Tried to disrespect Taylor 'cause Taylor wasn't Swift enough,1
Pillsbury Doughgirl; Remy pick the biscuit up,1
"I'm jealous? Bitch, you was happy when they took me",0
Best thing that ever happened to you was when they booked me,1
"You said you never fucked Wayne – how stupid I look, B?",1
"Get the picture, I'll expose you, I'm kind of a bully",1
"You named yourself Nicki Lewinsky, the mind of a rookie",1
'Cause you was suckin' his dick and now he tired of your nookie,1
You claimed you never fucked Drake,1
Now that's where you took me,1
"You fucked the whole Empire – who you tryin' to be, Cookie?",1
"Boogie Down Bronx, I come out of the Boogie",1
To let you know real bitches never lie on their pussy,1
"And stop talkin' numbers, you signed a 360 deal",1
"Through Young Money, through Cash Money, through Republic",1
Which means your money go through five niggas before you touch it,1
"Any videos, promotions come out of your budget",1
"Endorsements, tour and merchandise, they finger-fuck it",1
"You make, like, 35 cents off of each ducat",1
"I own my masters, bitch, independent",1
"So for every sale I do, you gotta do like ten",0
"Stop comparin' yourself to Jay, you not like him",1
"You a motherfuckin' worker, not a boss like Rem",1
"You're done, them pop chicks ain't get the news yet",1
"Bitch, I pop chicks, yeah, and I'm the new vet",1
"I kill rappers, and you good as dead, bitch",1
Talkin' shit about me to a deaf bitch,1
And usually I have sympathy for the impaired,1
But not when you hard of hearin' from untreated gonorrhea,1
But you point your fingers at me? I’m the bad girl,1
When she the one out here misleadin' the black girls?,1
All these fake-asses influenced by that girl,1
Dyin' from botched surgeries – what a sad world!,1

"Suckin' cock for records, captain of the cum squad",1
And I got a few words for the moms of the young Barbz,1
Guess who supports a child molester? Nicki Minaj,1
You paid for your brother’s wedding? That’s hella foul,1
How you spendin' money to support a pedophile?,1
"He a walkin' dead man, sendin' threats to him",1
"I guess that’s why they call you Barbie, you was next to Ken",1
Talkin’ about your money long and your foreign sick,1
Why you ain’t help your bro hide his cum from forensics?,1
"You probably somewhere overseas, foreign sick",1
"Thought you could fuck with me, by far Rem sick",1
"Meek, Drake, Safaree, I see men in your pants",1
"We call that Jelani, get it? Semen in your pants",1
"Uh, I got trigger fingers, you got bitter fingers",1
"Yeah, you must think you Drake and I'm Twitter fingers",1
"VH1, watch this",1
You just got bodied by a Love & Hip-Hop bitch,1
[Outro],0
Don't ever in your fuckin' life play with me,1
That's on the set!,1
You tried it on the Rae Sremmurd record,1
You tried it on your little freestyle,1
"They was both duds, just like every other one was duds",1
Just like this last one was a dud,1
But what you not gonna do is keep subbin' me,1
Big… Pun!,1
