[Verse],0
I been spending all this money 'cause I might not see the sun again,1
"I've been smoking drugs in the slums, have you running when",0
"I step on the scene, I ain't mean, boy, I just ain't your friend",0
"You been off the shits, off some shit that I don't reccomend",0
"I been on my shit, that's why these women on my dick",1
"I ain't even got a job, I get some money, make it flip",1
"See you running like a bitch, just chasing dreams you'll never get",0
"And I dont need to dream, because to me my dreams are dead",0
"I can only make it happen, I ain't happy in the end",1
"Just a little satisfaction, if that's all that I can get",1
"See me dressed in my own fashion, I don't have to fuck with trends",1
"It's OmenXIII, the assassin, steady clashing 'til the end",0
Then I'm back into the shadows where they cannot seem to see,1
"See, to me my life's a battle and I'll have to face defeat",1
But until that fucking happens I'll keep rapping on these beats,0
And I'm repping 10 black nails 'til OmenXIII R.I.P,0
"Bitch, I started doing me, because I lost my will to live",0
But I can't give into the pain because the pain is not my friend,1
"But it helps me feel alive, so I respect for what it is",1
"And I tried to keep it cool, but now my patience wearing thin",0
[Hook],0
My mind is in constant motion,0
Thoughts created by the slightest notion,0
I'm screaming out for hope and,0
The same thoughts strangle 'til I'm choking,0
