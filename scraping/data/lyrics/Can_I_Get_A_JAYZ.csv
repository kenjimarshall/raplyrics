[Verse 1: Jay-Z],1
Can I hit in the mornin' without givin' you half of my dough,1
"And even worse, if I was broke would you want me",1
If I couldn't get you finer things like all of them diamond rings,1
Bitches kill for would you still roll,1
If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand,1
"Would you ride then, if I wasn't driving",1
"If I wasn't a, eight-figure nigga by the name of Jigga",1
Would you come around me or would you clown me,1
"If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya",1
"Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya",1
See yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five,1
"Ten to six, two jobs to survive,",1
or,1
"Do you need a baller, so you can shop and tear the mall up",1
"Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya",1
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low,1
"Baby girl, if this is so, yo",1

You ain't gotta be rich but fuck that,0
