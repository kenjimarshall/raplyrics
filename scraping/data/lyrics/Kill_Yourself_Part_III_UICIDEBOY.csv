[Intro: Butterfly Boucher],0
"It's not fair, I found love",1
It made me say to get back,1
You'll never see daylight,1
"If I'm not strong, it just might",1
"It's not fair, I found love",1
It made me say to get back,1
You'll never see daylight,1
"If I'm not strong, it just might",1
[Verse 1: RUBY DA CHERRY],0
They figure me a dead motherfucker,1
But I'm just a motherfucker that wanna be dead,1
"$now Leopard with the lead in his head, turnin' me into a sweater",1
Bitches use me as their fucking bedspread,1
I be the silhouette of a sunset,1
Smoke a cigarette while I compress my depression,1
"Stare into the violet fluorescent lights, makes me violent",1
I'm tryna get the highest I can get before I overdose and die,1
"My ribs are nothing but an empty cage, black hole in my chest",1
"Big bang,",1
Yung Plague on the tip of a wave,1
"In my head, I feel like I'm a guest, so I'ma throw it all away",1
"Because when I am dead, I will be nothing decomposin' in a grave",1
"I'm matter, but I don't matter",1
I can feel my skull shatter from the dull chatter,1
Brain splattered on the wall,1
"Grey stains won't dissolve, gonna have to paint it all",1
[Bridge: Butterfly Boucher],0
"It's not fair, I found love",1
It made me say to get back,1
You'll never see daylight,1
"If I'm not strong, it just might",1
[Verse 2: $LICK $LOTH],0
Always boasting my emotions on how I'm so fucking broken,1
Think I'm joking when I'm talkin' about blowing my head open,1
'Till the moment you walk in and find my body motionless,1
Wrists slit,1
"Thoughts of $licky falling in an open pit, shit",1
Always burn my bridges 'cause I'd rather fall in ditches,1
"If life's a game of inches, then my dick has been the biggest",1
And my goal's to fuck the world until that motherfucker's twitchin',1
"Lane switchin', same mission, to die and blame my addiction, bitch",1
[Outro: Butterfly Boucher],0
"It's not fair, I found love",1
It made me say to get back,1
You'll never see daylight,1
"If I'm not strong, it just might",1
