[Intro],0
Teen drinking is very bad,1
"Yo, I",0
got a fake ID though,1
"Yeah, yeah, yeah",0
"Yo, two step with me, two step with me",0
[Verse 1],0
"One, here comes the two to the three to the four",1
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor,0
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more,0
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour,0
Maybe 'cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore,0
Or maybe 'cause she heard that I buy out the stores,0
Bottom of the ninth and a nigga gotta score,1
If not I gotta move on to the next whore,0
Here comes the three to the two to the one,0
"Homeboy trippin', he don't know I got a gun",0
"When it come to pop, man, we do shit for fun",0
"You ain't got one? Nigga, you better run",0
Now I'm in the back gettin' head from my hun,0
"While she goin' down, I'm braggin' on what I done",0
She smokin' my blunt sayin' she ain't havin' fun,0
"Bitch, give it back, now you don't get none",0
[Chorus],0
"Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy",0
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy),0
"Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy",0
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy),0
"Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy",0
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy),0
"Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy",0
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy),0
[Verse 2],0
"Two, here comes the three to the four to the five",0
Now I'm lookin' at shorty right in her eyes,0
"Couple seconds pass, now I'm lookin' at her thighs",0
While she tellin' me how much she hate her guy,0
Say she got a kid but she got her tubes tied,0
"Girl, you twenty-one? Girl, that's alright",0
I'm wonderin' if a shake comin' with them fries,0
"If so, baby, can I get 'em super-sized?",0
Here comes the four to the three to the two,0
She started feelin' on my Johnson right out the blue,0
"Girl, you super thick so I'm thinkin' that's cool",0
"But instead of one life hat, I need two",0
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels,0
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue,0
Then she told me she don't run with the crew,0
You know how I do but that's just what I gotta do,0
[Chorus],0
"Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy",0
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy),0
"Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy",0
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy),0
"Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy",0
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy),0
"Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy",0
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy),0
[Verse 3],0
"Three, here comes the four to the five to the six",1
"Self explanatory, I ain't gotta say I'm rich",0
"Yes, single man, I ain't tryin' to get hitched",0
"Liquor wasted on me, man, son of a bitch",1
"Brushed it-it off, now I'm back to gettin' lit",0
"With some orange juice, man, this some good ish",0
Homeboy trippin' 'cause I'm starin' at his chick,0
Now he on the sideline starin' at my clique,0
Here comes the five to the four to the three,0
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me,0
"Club owner said, ""Kwon put out those trees!""",0
"Dude, I don't care, I'm a P.I.M.P.",1
[Chorus],0
"Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy",0
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy),0
"Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy",0
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy),0
"Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy",0
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy),0
"Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy",0
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy),0
