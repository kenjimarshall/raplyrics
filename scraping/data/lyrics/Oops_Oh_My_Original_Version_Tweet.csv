We ain't goin' nowhere,0
[Verse I: Tweet],0
I'll tell ya what I did last night,1
"I came home, say around a quarter to three",1
"Still so high, hypnotized",1
"In a trance, from this body",1
So buttery brown and tantalizing,1
You would have thought I needed help,1
From the feeling that I felt,1
So shook I had to catch my breath,1

"OOPS! There goes my shirt up over my head, oh my",1
"OOPS! There goes my skirt droppin to my feet, oh my",1
"OOH! Some kind of touch caressing my face, oh my",1
OOH! I'm turnin' red who could this be,1
[Verse II],0
I tried and I tried to avoid,1
But this thing was happening,1
"Swallow my pride, let it ride",1
"And partied,",1
but this body felt just like mines,1
I got worried,1
I looked over to the left,1
A reflection of myself,1
That's why I couldn't catch my breath,1
