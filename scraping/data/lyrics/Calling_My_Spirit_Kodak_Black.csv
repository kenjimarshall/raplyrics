[Verse 1],0
I put my heart in my lyrics,1
I gave it all I could give,0
I made it hot at the crib,0
I kept that fire at the crib,0
Where you gon' go when you dip?,1
How I'ma know who for real?,1
I pour a four in a fifth,1
You already know what it is,0
I keep a pole in the whip,0
'Cause a lot of these niggas out here envy me,0
It ain't no ho in the clique,0
None of my dawgs got fuckboy tendencies,0
I don't even show no sympathy,0
"Sipping on Hennessy, got me bending sideways",1
"Everything on me drippin', you niggas can't ride the wave",0
"Nigga run around with the juice, nigga come spill your drank",0
I done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank,0
[Chorus],0
Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision,1
"Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz",0
It's like,0
you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention,1
"Fuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in it",1
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious,1
"And it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits",0
[Verse 2],0
I put my Hublot on rocks,1
I put Moscato on rocks,0
Where I’m from we don’t say opp,0
Shoot at an,0
OV,1
", shoot at a cop",0
"Shoot at the police, shoot at your top",0
I made a million off socks,1
Free all my niggas who stuck in a box,1
Locked up and watching the clock,0
"Locked up, they fighting with locks",0
"Locked up, they swinging they knifes",0
I can't be living this life,0
"No more Bacardi, alright",1
I don't want Cardi so I'ma pour Henny on ice,1
"My vision is vivid, told you I'm really a menace",0
I'll show you I'm destined to get it,0
I be outside with the glizzy,0
"Toting that fire, I be trippin'",0
I just might die how I'm livin',0
"Ain't take no bath, but I'm drippin'",0
"Niggas ain't catching me slipping, ayy, yeah",0
I make you laugh when you with me,0
"Know that my swag is terrific (Glee, glee)",0
Ain't seen my dad in a minute,1
"But I can't be mad, I got millions",1
I just pulled up in a lemon,0
"Thuggin', so fuck your opinion",0
"I'm thuggin', so fuck how you feeling",0
I'm calling my spirit,0
[Chorus],0
Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision,1
"Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz",0
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention,0
"Fuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in it",0
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious,0
"And it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits",0
