We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin',1
[Verse 1],0
"Now, let me get some action from the back section",0
We need body rockin' not perfection,0
Let your backbone flip but don't slip a disc,1
And let your spine unwind — just take a risk,0
I wanna' do the freak until the break of dawn,1

And up-rockin',1

"Flame on, I'm gone",1
I'm so sweet like a nice bonbon,1
Came out rapping when I was born,1
Mom said rock it 'til the break of dawn,1
Puttin' bodies in motion 'cause I got the notion,1
Like Roy Cormier,1
with the coconut lotion,1
The sound of the music makin' you insane,0
You can't explain to people this type of mind frame,0
Like a bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape,1
I'm fine like wine when I start to rap,1
"We need body-rockin', not perfection",0
Let me get some action from the back section,1

"Mike D, with the master plan",1
"I said, Ooh my-my and thank you, ma'am",1
"And when I grab the mic, you scream, ""Ooh, goddamn""",0
The crème de la crème is who I am,1
"MCA, where have you been?",0
Packed like sardines in the tin,1
So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins,0
'Cause,0
when it comes to quarries I'm known to swim,1
"And Adrock, light up the place",0
"And if you pull my card, you pull the ace",1
"And if you ask me, turn up the bass",0
And if you play defender,1
I could be your hyperspace... So,1

"Body movin', body movin'",0
"A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing",0
"Body movin', body movin'",0

"""You will do eight hops on the left, eight on the right",0
"Four left, four right, two left, two right, the one each",0
"Left right, left right. Start and land on the balls of the feet",0
"Left foot... Ready? It's one two three four five""",0
