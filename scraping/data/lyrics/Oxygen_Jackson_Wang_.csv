[Verse 1],0
I'm topless walking on the frontline with no ammo,0
I know I might get shot but I still go though (Go though),0
"Go hard, go hard, go hard in beast mode",0
All I wish is the clock be ticking in slow mo,0
In a room with no exit not expecting things to be like this,0
Time keeps passing by I'm just gonna slowly close my eyes,0
"Can't breathe for now I might die, just hoping you'll be mine",0
"Come back to my life, come back to my life, ayy",0

"Dive so deep in the ocean, yeah",0
"I ain't no life vest protection, yeah",0
"A hundred meters down below, even when it's a hundred hours long",0
Nothing matters anymore when I went down there,0
"Staying by my side we can conquer, yeah",0
Maybe I can be your Aquaman,0
Underwater we can travel everywhere,0
"Riding on the road, ain't got no traffic lights (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)",0
Vibing out all night long be my miss right (Miss right),0
"Deep in your shadows I dive, want you to be in my life",0
"'Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I live off you",0
