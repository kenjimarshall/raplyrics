[Produced by Jeff Bass],1
[Intro: Frogg],1
"Woah, a-get yo' hands in the air",1
"And get to clappin' 'em and, like, back and forth",1
Because a-this is what you thought it wasn't,1
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen,1
"I be the F-R-O, the double G",1
"And check out my man, he goes by the name of, um, er-",1
[Verse 1: Eminem],1
"Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady",1
"I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady",1
"I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer",1
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer,1
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit yo' style from,1
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album,1
"Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open",1
"I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then",1
"My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi, Marshall)",1
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it,1
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip yo' cash,0
Bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' ass,1
"Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin",1
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson (Pssh),1
"The proof is in the puddin', just ask DeShaun Holton",1
I'll slit yo' motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman,1
[Chorus: Eminem],0
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks,1
"Screamin', ""Fuck the world"" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)",1
"Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'",1
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck),1
"So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends",1
My shit is wack,1
(I just don't give a fuck),1
But see me on the street and duck,1
"'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed",1
('Cause I just don't give a fuck),1
[Verse 2: Eminem],0
"I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone",1
"I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone",1
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason,1
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin',1
"Flavor with no seasoning,",1
this is the sneak preview,1
I'll diss yo' magazine and still won't get a weak review,1
"I'll make yo' freak leave you,",0
smell the Folgers crystals,1
"This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols",0
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles,1
"Slim Shady, M&M was the old initials (Bye-bye)",1
"Extortion, snortin',",1
supportin' abortion,1
"Pathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion",1
"The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic",1
"Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict",1
"Half animal, half man",1
Dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can,1
With more holes than an afghan,1
[Chorus: Eminem],0
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks,1
"Screamin', ""Fuck the world"" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)",1
"Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'",1
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck),1
"So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends",1
My shit is wack,1
(I just don't give a fuck),1
But see me on the street and duck,1
"'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed",1
('Cause I just don't give a fuck),1
[Verse 3: Eminem],0
"Somebody let me out this limousine (Hey, let me out)",1
I'm a caged demon,1
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine,1
I'm convinced I'm a fiend,1
Shootin' up while this record is spinnin',1
"Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion",0
"Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure",1
I'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher,1
"I can't take the pressure,",1
I'm sick of bitches,1
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes,1
"In school, I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush",1
"Doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush",1
"Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed",1
"Went to gym in eighth grade, ***** the women's swim team",1
"Don't take me for a joke,",1
I'm no comedian,1
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again,1
"I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median",1
Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in,1
[Chorus: Eminem],0
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks,1
"Screamin', ""Fuck the world"" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)",1
"Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'",1
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck),1
"So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends",1
My shit is wack,1
(I just don't give a fuck),1
But see me on the street and duck,1
"'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed",1
('Cause I just don't give a fuck),1
[Outro: Eminem],0
"(Shit, fuck everybody)",1
"Outsiderz, Pacewon, Young Zee (Fuck the entire world)",1
