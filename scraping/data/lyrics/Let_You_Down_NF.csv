[Chorus],0
Feels like we're on the edge right now,1
I wish that I could say I'm proud,1
I'm sorry that I let you down,1
Let you down,1
All these voices in my head get loud,1
I wish that I could shut them out,1
I'm sorry that I let you down,1
Le-le-let you down,1
[Verse 1],0
"Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can",0
"I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying",1
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do,1
"Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you",1
Thought about everything you were never even wrong,1
"In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you",1
Walking towards you with my head down,0
"Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you",0
"Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?",0
That's parents for you,0
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back,1
But you put a knife in it—my hands are full,1
What else should I carry for you?,0
"I cared for you, but…",0
[Chorus],0
Feels like we're on the edge right now,1
I wish that I could say I'm proud,1
I'm sorry that I let you down,1
Le-le-let you down,1
All these voices in my head get loud,1
I wish that I could shut them out,1
I'm sorry that I let you down,1
Le-le-let you down,1
[Verse 2],0
"Yeah, you don't wanna make this work",1
You just wanna make this worse,1
"Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words",1
"You don't wanna know my hurt, yeah",0
"Let me guess, you want an apology, probably",0
How can we keep going at a rate like this?,0
"We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave",0
"Please, don't come after me",0
"I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all",0
"Go ahead, just drink it off",0
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong,0
Ain't that what you always do?,0
"I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood",0
What else can I offer you?,0
"There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you",0
[Chorus],0
Feels like we're on the edge right now,1
I wish that I could say I'm proud,1
I'm sorry that I let you down,1
Le-le-let you down,1
All these voices in my head get loud,1
I wish that I could shut them out,1
I'm sorry that I let you down,1
Le-le-let you down,1
[Verse 3],0
"Yeah, don't talk down to me",0
That's not gonna work now,0
Packed all my clothes and I moved out,0
I don't even wanna go to your house,0
Every time I sit on that couch,0
"I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we",0
Coulda made this work,0
And prolly woulda figured things out,0
But I guess I'm a letdown,0
"But it's cool, I checked out",0
"Oh, you wanna be friends now?",0
"Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now",0
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen,0
"I mean, why are you laughing?",0
"Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction",0
"No, but at least you're happy",0
[Chorus],0
Feels like we're on the edge right now,1
I wish that I could say I'm proud,1
I'm sorry that I let you down,1
"Oh, I let you down",1
All these voices in my head get loud,1
And I wish that I could shut them out,1
I'm sorry that I let you down,1
"Oh, let you down",1
[Outro],0
I'm sorry,1
I'm so sorry now,1
"Yeah, I'm sorry that I let you down",1
