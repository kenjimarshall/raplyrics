[Verse 1],0
Sister sits on the steps,0
Cigarette rests on fingertips,0
Takes a sip of slow death deftly through her lips,1
She blows a kiss,1
Which I can only resist in vain,1
She got the gift of gravity pulling to ask her name,1
"She says, ""Sagaba""",1
"What's it mean? She says, ""In Ilocano",1
"It translates into suffering.""",1
I'm pondering the irony to conjure up the fearlessness to find a conversation,1
"She offers me a square, I decline the invitation",1
It reminds me of the days when I would chain smoke,1
Broken with no hope,1
Like broken like the manner she spoke,1
We both,1
Two people seeking,1
Solace and remembrance,1
And wondering if miracles were meant for us,1
But intent was just an innocent thought between a sister and a brother,1
Who been building in the guidance of a mother,0
And the storyteller stops,0
Waiting for the beat to drop,0
"Gathering his thoughts in the wind, breathing in like...",0
[Verse 2],0
Now,0
I couldn't stand to see the queen breathe her dreams away,1
And tell me her tomorrow will never become today,1
I say I used to know a woman just like you,1
Beautiful but jaded by the multitude of men who'd often try to,1
Justify their lies with twisted notions of survival,1
And hide behind their armor when karma completes a cycle,1
She replied,1
That just because I knew a woman well it doesn't mean I know them all,1
She begins to bade farewell,1
"Eyes up to the sky, she sighs, I need nobody",1
"True indeed, sister, but you still need everybody because",1
We hardly know ourselves if we know nobody else,1
And only in our loneliness can home become a hell,1
Exhale,1
The cloud,1
in the loudest form of silence,0
Watches as it rises like suns over horizons,1
The storyteller stops,1
Waiting for the beat to drop,1
"Gathering his thoughts in the cloud, breathing out like.",1
..,0
[Verse 3],0
Dreams be the ashes,1
Burns and thrashing in the wind,1
Flying out the burning bush attached to sister's hand,0
"Who whispers, ""word""",1
"Smiling and giving thanks, living in doubt no longer",1
As she figures out the riddle to the song,1
Saying why must we suffer now to not suffer later if later,1
Never comes soon enough to soothe the hatred,1
And hatred,1
Is the cancer born out of love's absence,1
And the absence is the void left from missing every chance to,1
Challenge our fates and perhaps our very names,1
Sister says peace and prayers for rain and change,1
Tosses out her lighter,1
Walks out of the cipher,0
For shizzle it starts to drizzle and then I begin to write this,0
Inhale the imagery a queen walking steadily,0
Effortlessly,0
Ready to be,0
Every woman and now the,0
Story teller ends,0
Waiting for the beat to fade,1
Gathering his thought near the edge of the day like...,1
