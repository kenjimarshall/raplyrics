[Verse 1: Kevin Rudolf],0
"I see your dirty face, hide behind your collar",0
"What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow",1
So you pray to God to justify the way,1
"You live a lie, live a lie, live a lie",1
And you take your time,0
And you do your crime,0
"Well, you made your bed",0
I made mine,0
[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf],0
"Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire",0
"Make you come alive, I can take you higher",0
"What this is, forgot, I must now remind you",0
"Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock",0
[Verse 2: Kevin Rudolf],0
"Now the son's disgraced, he who knew his father",0
"When he cursed his name, turned and chased the dollar",1
"But it broke his heart, so he stuck his middle finger",0
"To the world, to the world, to the world",0
And you take your time,1
And you stand in line,1
"Well, you'll get what's yours",1
I got mine,1
[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf],0
"Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire",0
"Make you come alive, I can take you higher",0
"What this is, forgot, I must now remind you",0
"Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock",0
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne],0
Yeoaw!,0
"Wayne's World, Planet Rock",1
"Panties drop, and the tops",0
And she gonna rock 'til the camera stop,0
And I sing about angels like Angela,0
(Rock!) And Pamela,0
(Rock!) And Samantha,0
(Rock!) And Amanda,0
"And Tamara,",0
ménage à moi,1
"I'm in here like, ""Bitch, what's up?""",0
"Mechanic, me, I can fix you up",0
"I can dick you up, I can dick you down",0
"Shorty, we can go wherever, just pick a town",0
And my jewelry is louder than an engine sound,0
Big-ass rocks like on the ground,0
Dirty like socks that's on the ground,0
Weezy,0
[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf],0
"Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire",0
"Make you come alive, I can take you higher",0
"What this is, forgot, I must now remind you",0
"Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock",0
"Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire",0
"Make you come alive, I can take you higher",0
"What this is, forgot, I must now remind you",0
"Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock",0
"Just let it rock, let it rock, let it rock",0
Let it rock,0
Let it rock,0
[Verse 4: Lil Wayne],0
"I'm back like I forgot somethin', I'm somethin'",0
Ruling rock rubbin' rap running,1
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach,0
Like Wayne the personal trainer,0
"My aim is perfect, I'll bang ya",0
"Period, like the reminder",0
[Outro: Kevin Rudolf],0
And I wish I could be as cruel as you,0
And I wish I could say the things you do,0
But I can't and I won't live a lie,0
"No, not this time",0
