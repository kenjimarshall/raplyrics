[Chorus],0
I'm a real drank head,0
"Real drank head, real drank head, real drank head",0
"Real drank head, real drank head, real drank head",0
Remember when Tech used to come in a coffin,0
Remember Actavis came with a double seal,0
And I had just poured me a 12 of Wock,0
You can keep the Qualitest all to yourself,0
"Cause nigga I'm a real drank head, real drank head",0
"You ain't sipping drank, that shit head",0
"Hoes in my car, asking me for a cup, that's his bitch",0
I should've known she ain't sip drink when she said Qualitest was better than Actavis,0
"I called cuban for 12 pints of Wock, any other nigga better know that he's taxing shit",0
[Verse 1],0
It's payday every day,0
"You ain't tryna fuck, bitch, skate",0
"Can't come through,",0
ball and no chain,1
"Adios, knock 'em back to 5th grade",0
And what I'm sippin',0
on a milkshake,1
I'm sharper than a switchblade,0
"All hundreds on me, but I'm on a rampage",0
"My ice kicking ass, no MMA",0
"Yeah, I'm sippin' Hardt",0
"I just poured a 12, you be pouring 4's",0
"You be sipping yellow, you be sipping green",0
"That shit deadly, you need to stick to weed",0
I got 20 pints up in my closet,0
They gon' be down for the week up,0
This bitch got up in my car,0
Told the bitch put on a seatbelt,0
She steady asking how to lift the seat up,0
Had the nerve to ask me for a lean cup,0
Where your ass was at for the re-up?,0
The drank just hit with me a prenup,0
"Bang, bang",0
[Chorus],0
I'm a real drank head,0
"Real drank head, real drank head, real drank head",0
"Real drank head, real drank head, real drank head",0

[Verse 2],0
I'm up in Houston where this shit came from,0
"Didn't know about bank accounts, I went and made one",0
"You got red in here, get away from my dope",0
"This bitch too damn playful, spilled drank on my clothes",0
"Love no thotties, I don't",0
Hopped out of a Rhino,0
"Your life fugazi, you need to undo",0
"Backspace, typeover",0
"Drank made me go, ""I need you"" (need you)",0
If it ain't purple then I can't see you (see you),0
"Bitch just text me saying ""I'm gon'",0
free,1
"you when I see you""",0
"I'm a well known nigga, you a Dr. Doolittle",0
I'm sipping on beetlejuice,0
"Call a camera man, it's a photoshoot",0
"Me and 20 pints, I pour 'em by the 2",0
"Bang, bang",0
