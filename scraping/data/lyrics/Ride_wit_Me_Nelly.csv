"Come on, now",0
[Chorus: Nelly],0
If you want to go and take a ride with me,0
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's,1
"Oh, why do I live this way?",0
"(Hey, must be the money!)",0
If you want to go and get high with me,0
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E,0
"Oh, why must I feel this way?",0
"(Hey, must be the money!)",0
[Verse 1: Nelly],0
"In the club on the late night, feeling right",0
"Looking, trying to spot something real nice",0
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home,0
(I can take home) She can be,0
18 (18) with an attitude,0
"Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude",0
But as long as you a thicy-thicy-thic girl you know that it's on,1
(You know that it's on) I peep something,0
"Coming towards me on the dance floor, sexy and real slow",0
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video,0
"""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?",0
"Her measurements was 36-25-34, tell it",0
I like the way you brush your hair,1
And I like those stylish clothes you wear,1
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare,0
"And I can see you, boo, from way over there",0

[Verse 2: Nelly],0
"Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act",1
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back,0
"You should feel the impact, shop on plastic",0
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that,1
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range,0
"Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes",1
"It feel strange now, making a living off my brain",0
"Instead of 'caine now, I got the title from my",0
"Momma put the whip in my own name now, damn shit done",0
"Changed now, running credit checks with no shame now",0
"I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)",0
"Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town",0
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B,0
Telling me about a party up in NYC,0
"And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight",0
"Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White, c'mon",1

[Bridge: Nelly],0
"Check, check, yo",0
I know something you don't know,0
And I've got something to tell ya,0
You wonâ€™t believe how many people straight doubted the flow,0
Most said that I was a failure,0
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough,0
"And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""",0
"""But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?""",0
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!,0
[Verse 3: City Spud],0
"Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and",0
I fly high,1
"Niggas want to know why, why I fly by",0
"But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood",0
"Do me like you should, fuck me good, suck me good",0
"We be them stud niggas, ""wishing you was"" niggas",0
"Popping like we drug dealers,",0
sipping Chrissy,1

"Honey in the club, me in the Benz",0
"Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends",0
"So if shorty wanna... knock, we knocking to this",0
"And if shorty wanna... rock, we rocking to this",0
"And if shorty wanna... pop, we popping the Crist'",0
"Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist",0
"City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen",1
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention,0
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring or they diss,1
"Honies looking all ""they wish,"" come on boo, gimme kiss, c'mon",0
