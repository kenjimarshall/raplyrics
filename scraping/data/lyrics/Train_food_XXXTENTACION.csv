[Chorus],0
I remember I had walked home that day,1
Content with all my misery,1
"Told myself it'd get better, no clue what there was next for me",1
"Remember there was people, walkin', talkin' in the distance",1
I was dressed for winter weather,1
"But the summer rays were kissing me, I—",1
I was lost,1
[Verse 1],0
So I took a different path,1
In the distance he awaited me,1
"Had no weapon, I'm guessin' his hands were just enough for me",1
"Was no question, I'm guessin' he laughed just at the sight of me",1
I was lost,0

"And there he was, his presence was alarming",1
"As he approached, was casual, we talked 'bout self-harming",1
"He told me, ""Kid, you shouldn't be walkin' on your own""",0
"He smiled and laughed, and pat my back",0
"He asked, ""How far are you from home?""",0
"I said, ""Maybe 30 minutes""",0
"His frequency distorted quick, I seen it in his image",0
"I should've run right fucking there, a—",1

"You ever woke up on a train track, with no motherfuckin' clothes on?",0
"Death before your eyes, you prayin' to God, but ain't no response",1
"Tryna scream for hope, just a shoulder that you can lean on",0
"But ain't nobody comin', so you scream on and scream on and scream on",0
While this evil fuck laugh at you,0
"Train getting closer, you still surprised that he battered you",0
"Tears falling harder and harder, minutes get minuscule",0
"Could've had a son or a daughter, now what you finna do?",1
You finna die here on this train track,0
"'Cause clearly after death, ain't no way you can find your way back",0
"Thinking 'bout your previous memories, going way back",0
All them fucking dreams 'bout a diamond chain and a Maybach,1
Now your time finally up,1
"Ask yourself this final question, is you going down or up?",1
Recollectin' all the moments that you never gave a fuck,1
"Now it's here, death has now arrived, time's finally up",1
