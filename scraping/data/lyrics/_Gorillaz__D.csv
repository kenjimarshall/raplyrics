[Verse 1: Proof],0
"The new terrors in rock, on every block",0
"Late for school, late for work",0
But ahead of these cops,0
"My credit is shot, end up dead in a box, right?",1
Until my life ends as pathetic as Pac's,1
"A waste of the talent, they say my boys is just nowhere",0
"Placed on the planet, remain in poisonous warfare",0
Derelict Arabic terrorists in the air,0
"Shit, arrogant, apparent to punish people by their heritage",0
"NATO mirrors, hate embarrassed",0
There is the faith to cherish,0
In your room face to face with race awareness,0
"A race to scare off the army bombing, your God is with you",0
"Calm over war, we got a starter pistol",0
"'Cause if you right, and know you right, then where's your righteous ways?",0
"We sacrifice, snatch your life, many nights and days",0
"Follow me into equality, we might behave",0
And only Christ can save the trife when we unite again,0
[Verse 2: Kuniva],0
"America's own, without a fucking care in my dome",0
"Barin' my bones, I'm far away staring at home",0
"Stay at my zone, falling asleep, lay with my chrome",0
Fahrenheit from these rockets burning like straightening combs,0
"Stay in the streets, bullshit and praying for peeps",0
"Spray at your peeps for christmas, give a K to my niece",1
"Real niggas feel us and fear us, Gorillaz beat on they chest when",0
"Danger is near us, I hope that you hear us",0
The spirit of Bugz is still in me,1
"God bless it, the Trinity",0
"Cause my bullets, they come in threes like trilogies",0
"Put the knife away, missles always strike and blaze",0
So much smoke you can't tell the difference of night and day,0
"Right away, blow your life away, so light your haze",0
Hold tight grenedes so when it blows I'm slightly grazed,0
"Kuniva might be crazed, unleashing unlikely rage",0
The next time you hear a verse from me I might be caged,0

[Verse 3: Bizarre],0
Every night I talk to a black hawk,0
"Taking heroin in bulks, watch my body hit the chalks",0
"I'm too lazy, mescaline's got me crazy",0
"Rape this old lady, while the bitch was having a baby",0
"And I ain't never going home, Bizarre too far gone",0
This cold got me deciphering right from wrong,0
As I sit in my seat and remain calm,1
And close my eyes and wait for the bomb,1
(Here it comes!),1
[Verse 4: Swifty],0
"I'm getting the fuck on, I'm aggravated",0
"I know I'll make it, I'm in a place full of hatred",0
Treating my life like it's sacred,0
"Try to check me, I break your neck",1
"Disrespect me, you'll get injected",1
It's hectic when some bullshit happen when you least expect it,1
"But we just won't accept it, nigga",1
I go ahead and lift my trigger,1
"Get rid of bitches, pay you a visit, then get your shit lit",1
I'm a nitwit with a big dick and big balls,0
I don't miss shit,0
"I hit all, whoever that did this",0
We gonna getchy'all,0

[Verse 5: Kon Artis],0
Now whether its Saddam or Bin Laden that's been startin' all this trouble for us,1
"Creeping horrors, doing show after show, sleeping on the tour bus",0
"We lost Aaliyah, lost our families, it takes no genius",0
"You dont need us to say the world is fucked up, y'all can see it",1
Now it seems the public needs this shit to calm its kids,1
'Cause they findin' out how you lied about your twisted sins,1
"They say we bad for you, but shit, our music is your friend",1
They can't deter you from the truth 'cause we the helping hand,1
[Bridge: Terry Hall],0
"We are one, and one is all",1
"We are, we are one",1
And one is all,1
