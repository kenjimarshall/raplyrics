I don't even know why I try,1
You did me wrong,1
And I can't forget that,1
Tell me what you want,1
I know it's a lie (Lie),1
You broke my heart,1
And you cannot fix that,1
You can't erase what you've done to me,1
"But certainly, all you do is burden me",1
It's hurting deep,1
Our past is like a blur to me,1
"It's hard to see, but look what you have done to me",1
