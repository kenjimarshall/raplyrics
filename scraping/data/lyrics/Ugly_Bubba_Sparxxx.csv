[Intro: Timbaland],0
"Uhh.. uh-oh, uh-oh",0
Tch-tchka-tchka-tchka-tchka uhh,0
"Uh-oh, uh-oh",0
Tchka-tchka uhh,0
"Uh-oh, uh-oh",0
"Say what, say what? Freaky freaky uhh",0
Tchka-tchka-tchka-tchka Bubba,0
[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx],0
Shit I ain't choose to rhyme; rhymin' chose me,0
So I hit the track runnin' - like a nosebleed,0
"Life ain't great now, but it's much improved",0
Yo' album droppin' this summer? That sucks for you,1
'Cause this is Bubba's moment - I put my mother on it,1
I said my momma; it seems as if I love her don't it?,0
"So buckle up, cause it's gon' get bumpy",0
"I call my girlfriends Betty's, and my shits grumpies",0
That Bubba talk - gotcha open wide,0
I giggle outside the booth; but ain't no joke inside,1
This is complicated - at least to y'all it is,0
"Just let me sell fifty million, then I'll call it quits",0
"But until that day, y'all in deep doo doo",0
I never once saw you crank it cause I just leap through you,0
"What you need to do, is just admit you love me",0
The South has always been Dirty but now it's gettin' ugly,0
[Chorus],0
Ugly - in here!,0
"Huh, in here! Huh, in here!",0
It's gon' get ugly - in here!,0
"Huh, in here! Huh, in here!",0
"It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly",0
"In here! Huh, in here!",0
It's gon' get ugly - in here!,0
"Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!",0
[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx],0
"Though I am country, don't get the wrong idea",0
"My ego's gettin' bigger, with every song I hear",0
"'Cause y'all been bullshittin', spittin' that booty chatter",0
Out here for two days and came with somethin' that truly matters,0
On goes the saga - of Bubba's plight,0
"She won't see tomorrow, if I don't cut tonight",0
That's just my mood now; I hate it came to this,0
How else can I say it I don't speak no other languages,0
"I'm fairly ripped now, so this the jimmy talkin'",0
You hear that beat don'tcha? That's just Timmy talkin',0
"Go 'head throw dem' bows - fuck it, break a bottle",0
Let's be honest none of us will ever date a model,0
"So let's just cut it loose, ignore the repercussions",0
"If you scared, then just forget what we discussin'",0
This that new South - take a picture of me,0
"'Cause I'm a fuckin' legend, and this is gettin' ugly",0
[Chorus],0
Ugly - in here!,0
"Huh, in here! Huh, in here!",0
It's gon' get ugly - in here!,0
"Huh, in here! Huh, in here!",0
"It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly",0
"In here! Huh, in here!",0
It's gon' get ugly - in here!,0
"Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!",0
[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx],0
Now this thang is jumpin' - ain't it somethin'?,0
"What makes it special, this whole moment came from nothin'",0
Now you see it triples; I bet she slurp tonight,0
Lames hide your wallets hatin' broads clutch your purses tight,0
"If you ain't tryin' to live, you with the wrong crowd",0
And if you feelin' brave then better sport that thong proud,0
"And if you finally breathin', then sing this song loud",0
I'm glad I got you wet I know you had a long drought,0
Don't worry about the law - they can't arrest us all,0
I had to crank couldn'ta done nothin' less for y'all,0
Forget your inhibitions; I wanna see you wylin',0
And if Bubba dies tonight - know he was smilin',0
[Chorus],0
Ugly - in here!,0
"Huh, in here! Huh, in here!",0
It's gon' get ugly - in here!,0
"Huh, in here! Huh, in here!",0
"It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly",0
"In here! Huh, in here!",0
It's gon' get ugly - in here!,0
"Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!",0
[Outro: Timbaland],0
"Ha ha, it's gon' get (uglyy - in here!)",0
"Thck-thck (Huh, in here! Huh, in here!)",0
It's gon' get (ugly - in here!),0
"(Huh, in here! Huh, in here!)",0
It's gon' get (ugly) say what?,0
"(Ugly, ugly) Say what? (Ugly!) In here! Huh, in here!",0
(It's gon' get ugly - in here!),0
"(Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!)",0

"{*Bubba's ""Ugly"" beat*} Now switch it back baby",0
