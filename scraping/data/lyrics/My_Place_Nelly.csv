[Verse 1: Nelly],0
I used to pride myself on being the other man,1
But now it's flipped and I don't want you with no other man,1
Why can't you understand that anything I'm offering,0
"I gave you the world, but you just wanted arguing",0
"From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped you off again",0
Even if flipped out on at the mall again,0
"""It's all his fault again,"" that's what you're telling all your friends",0
"I ain't pointing fingers ma, I just wanna call again",0
See how your day going I know they stressing on you,0
I know them times get hard that's why I'm checking on you,0
"It's yours truly ma, I got a little message for you",0
"Anything he can do, girl I can do better for you, 'cause",0
[Bridge: Nelly],0
"When we laugh or we cry, it's together",0
Through the rain and the stormiest weather,0
"We gon' still be as one, it's forever",0
"It's forever, it's forever",0
[Chorus: Jaheim],0
Won't you come on and go with me (come and go with me),1
"(Oh girl) Come on over to my place (my place, my place)",1
Won't you sit yourself down and take a seat,0
"And let me ease your mind girl, we gon' do it our way (our way)",0
[Verse 2: Nelly],0
I heard your friend tell a friend that told a friend of mine,0
That you was thinking that we should do it one more time,0
If this ain't the truth then hopefully it's not a lie,0
'Cause I ain't got no issue with hitting that another time,0
We never had a problem with getting it done,0
"Disagreed upon a lot ma, but the sex wasn't one",0
Now check it I know you get excited (still) when I come around and bite it,0
(Girl) quit frowning up and quit acting like you don't like it,0
"(I like it) I know you like, (I like it)",1
"You really like it, (I really, really like it)",1
"(I want it), I know you want it, (adore it)",1
"Adore it, (so come let me enjoy it)",1

[Verse 3: Nelly and (Jaheim)],0
"Shorty, where you been?",0
Feels like a long time,0
"Long, long time since I seen you",0
"Yes it has, girl",0
And I know I said some fucked-up things to you before,1
But girl you know I didn't mean it,1
(I'm sorry),0
I never meant one single word,0
If I could take back every word I would and more for sure,0
If I thought that you would believe it,0
(Would you believe it?),0
"Hey, girl, cause you make my life so convenient for me",0
[Bridge: Nelly],0
"When we laugh or we cry, it's together",0
Through the rain and the stormiest weather,0
"We gon' still be as one, it's forever",0
"It's forever, it's forever",0
[Chorus: Jaheim],0
Won't you come on and go with me (come and go with me),1
"(Oh girl) Come on over to my place (my place, my place)",1
Won't you sit yourself down and take a seat,0
