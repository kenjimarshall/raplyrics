[Intro],0
Young Chop on the Beat,0
Car I'm ridin' like a nightlight,0
So much cash that my pockets look pregnant,0
They all know I'm knocked up,0
"Ridin' like a nightlight, stop at the stoplight",0
"Drove off, ran the red light, there the cops is",0
Tryna put me into lock up,0
Remember having rocks in my timbos,0
Ran off with the coke money,0
"Pull up, bounce out the all-white thing",0
"Sosa, baby, GBE, baby",0
That there is a snow bunny,0
[Hook],0
"The car I'm riding, like a nightlight",0
Ain't gone stop at the stoplight,0
"I sip Barney, you sip stop sign, yeah that sounds about right",1
I wear astronaut clothes,0
"Pull up foreign, beat Kongo",0
Take 300 out Wells Fargo,0
"I don't wait in line, no bar-codes",0
You see your reflection in my ice,0
"I left you, boy you not right",0
My bitch so bad that's it's not nice,0
"Say hi, get top, then it's bye-bye",0
"You smokin' on low, boy you're not high",0
"I keep spinach, like Popeye",0
"Brown bag full of cash, no white rice",0
"All the cash out the bank, that's a light heist",0
[Verse 1],0
"Pull up, peeking out the car, no sound proof",0
"Let the MAC out the top, no sun roof",0
"Throwing cash out the top, I'ma bank-teller",0
Ride the car like I rode the Mongoose,0
Fill yo block up til it's no more,0
"Hear the SoundClick, no Johnny Juliano",0
"I'm on the high-speed, OJ in the bronco",0
Got the Yao Ming and Mutombo,0
I be with Smokey and the bandits,0
You a cat but you be with the rat pack,0
"Runnin' for the ball, intercept that",0
"If I don't, that's where you get sacked at",0
"Party too hot like Crisco, pop pop",0
"I got enough cream for the whole cafe, no Hard Rock",0
Remember having rocks in my timbos,0
Ran off with the coke money,0
"Pull up, bounce out the all-white thing",0
That there is a snow bunny,0
"Pull up to the show get the 40 G's, do that in one hour",0
What the fuck do I hop in when I leave,0
That there is a snow plower,0
[Hook],0
The car I'm ridin' like a nightlight,0
And I ain't gone stop at the stoplight,0
"I sip Barney, you sip stop sign, yeah that sounds about right",1
I wear astronaut clothes,0
"Pull up foreign, beat Kongo",0
Take 300 out Wells Fargo,0
"I don't wait in line, no bar-codes",0
You see your reflection in my ice,0
"I left you, boy you not right",0
My bitch so bad that's it's not nice,0
"Say hi, get top, then it's bye-bye",0
"You smokin' on low, boy you're not high",0
"I keep spinach, like Popeye",0
"Brown bag full of cash, no white rice",0
"All the cash out the bank, that's a light heist",0
[Verse 2],0
I'm like sticking a fork in a socket,0
Get your dumb ass shocked up,0
So much cash that my pockets look pregnant,0
They all know I'm knocked up,0
Had to go change my safety deposit,0
I told 'em put me in a locker,0
"Drove off, run the red light, there the cops is",0
Tryna put me into lock-up,0
Fuck a bitch so good she got me tatted,0
She wear me like a t-shirt,0
Got that big boy on my side,0
I wear,0
he,1
like a beeper,0
Came in and Steph Curry'd the game,0
Can you see me from the bleachers?,0
"Talked to God when I woke up this morning, I asked ""can you please keep from the leechers?""",0
"She know I keep cheese, velveet-er",0
She get a mouth fucked 'til her teeth hurt,0
"I take one ho upstairs, got a bitch right underneath her",0
I'm an All Star on the bench like Chuck,0
Throw some money up then the bitch got clucked,0
Shoot the bitch up and she fizz right up,0
Gave her some lean then she lit right up,0
[Chorus],0
The car I'm ridin' like a nightlight,0
And I ain't gone stop at the stoplight,0
"I sip barney, you sip stop sign, yeah that sounds about right",0
I wear astronaut clothes,0
"Pull up foreign, beat Kongo",0
Take 300 out Wells Fargo,0
"I don't wait in line, no bar-codes",0
You see your reflection in my ice,0
"I left you, boy you not right",0
My bitch so bad that's it's not nice,0
"Say hi, get top, then it's bye-bye",0
"You smokin' on low, boy you're not high",0
"I keep spinach, like Popeye",0
"Brown bag full of cash, no white rice",0
"All the cash out the bank, that's a light heist",0
[Outro],0
"Let the MAC out the top, no sunroof",0
Ride the car like I rode the Mongoose,0
"I'm on a high-speed, OJ in the Bronco",0
I be with Smokey and the Bandits,0
You a cat but you be with the Rat Pack,0
"Fire too high, like Crisco, pop pop",0
"I got enough cream for the cafe, no Hard Rock",0
