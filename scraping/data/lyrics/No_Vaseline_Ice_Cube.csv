[Verse 1],1
"Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off",1
"Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft",1
First you was down with the AK,1
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le,1
Looking like straight Bozos,1
"I saw it coming, that's why I went solo",1
And kept on stompin',1
While y'all mothafuckers moved straight outta Compton,1
Living with the whites,1
One big house and not another nigga in sight,1
I started off with too much cargo,1
Dropped four niggas now I'm making all the dough,1
White man just ruling,1
The Niggas With Attitudes? Who ya foolin'?,1
Y'all niggas just phony,1
I put that on my Mama and my dead homies,1
"Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losing",1
"Ay yo Dre, stick to producing",1
"Calling me Arnold, but you been-a-dick",1
Eazy-E saw your ass and went in it quick,1
You got jealous when I got my own company,1
"But I'm a man, and ain't nobody humping me",1
Trying to sound like Amerikkka's Most?,1
"You could yell all day, but you don't come close",1
'Cause you know I'm the one that flowed,1
"Ya done run 100 miles, but you still got one to go",1
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B,1
And y'all disgrace the C-P-T,1
'Cause you're getting fucked out your green,1
"By a white boy, with no vaseline",1
[Hook],0
Now you're getting done without vaseline,1
Now you're getting done without vaseline,1
Now you're getting done without vaseline,1
"Damn, it feels good to see people, on it",1
[Verse 2],1
"The bigger the cap, the bigger the peeling",1
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?,1
You're getting fucked real quick,1
And Eazy's dick is smelling like MC Ren's shit,1
Tried to tell you a year ago,1
"But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho, so",1
I couldn't stop you from getting ganked,1
Now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank,1
"Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it",1
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect,1
"Cut my hair? Naw, cut them balls",1
'Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers,1
"Gang-banged by your manager, fella",1
Getting money out your ass like a mothafucking Ready Teller,1
Giving up the dollar bills,1
Now they got The Villain with a purse and high-heels,1
So don't believe what Ren say,1
'Cause he's going out like Kunta Kinte,1
"But I got a whip for ya, Toby",1
"Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me",1
It's a case of divide-and-conquer,1
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew,1
House nigga gotta run and hide,1
"Yelling Compton, but you moved to Riverside",1
"So don't front, MC Ren",1
'Cause I remember when you drove a B-210,1
Broke as a mothafucking joke,1
Let you on the scene to back up the First Team,1
"It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart",1
And they ripping your asshole apart,1
By taking your green,1
"Oh yeah, The Villain does get fucked with no vaseline",1
[Hook],0
"Now you're getting done, get-getting done",1
"Now you're getting done, get-getting done",1
Now you're getting done without va-va-va-va-vaseline,1
[Verse 3],1
I never have dinner with the President,1
I never have dinner with the President,1
I never have dinner with the President,1
"And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant",1
Now I think you a snitch,1
Throw a house nigga in a ditch,1
"Half-pint bitch, fucking your homeboys, you little maggot",1
Eazy-E turned faggot,1
"With your manager, fella",1
"Fucking MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella",1
But if they were smart as me,1
Eazy-E a'be hanging from a tree,1
With no vaseline,1
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline,1
"Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on",1
Till that Jheri curl is gone,1
On a permanent vacation,1
Off the massa plantation,1
Heard you both got the same bank account,1
"Dumb nigga, what you thinking bout?!",1
Get rid of that Devil real simple,1
Put a bullet in his temple,1
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew,1
With a white jew telling you what to do,1
Pulling wools with your scams,1
Now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs,1
"With a midget who's a punk, too",1
"Tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you",1
"Eric Wright, punk, always into something",1
Gettin' fucked at night,1
By Mista Shitpacker,1
Bend over for the goddamn cracker,1
No vaseline,1
"Mothafuckin' nosejob having ass
Mothafucking Jheri Curl lite
Ambi wearing mothafuckin' bitch",0
