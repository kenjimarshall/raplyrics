I come from Bed-Stuy,1
Where niggas either do or they gon' die,1
Gotta keep the Ratchett close by,0
Someone murdered,1
"Nobody seen, nobody heard it",1
Just another funeral service,0
Niggas will get at you,0
"Come through shinin', they yap you",1
In broad daylight kidnap you,1
Feds get clap too,0
Police stay on us like tattoos,0
Niggas only grind 'cause we have to,0
Money is power,0
"Sling crack, weed, and powder",0
Fiends come through every hour,0
It's all about that dollar,0
And we no deal with cowards,0
Weak lamb get devoured,0
By the lion in the,0
concrete jungle,1
The strong stand and rumble,0
The weak fold and crumble,0
It's the land of trouble,0
Brooklyn home of the greatest rappers,1
BIG comes first then the queen comes after,0
