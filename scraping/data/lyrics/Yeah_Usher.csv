"Watch out, my outfit's ridiculous",0
In the club looking so conspicuous,0
"And roar, these women all on the prowl",1
"If you hold the head steady, I'ma milk the cow (yeah!)",1
"And forget about game, I'ma spit the truth (what?)",1
I won't stop till I get 'em in their birthday suit (yeah!),1
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes,1
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes,1
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls,1
"If they ain't cutting, then I put em on foot patrol (let's go!)",1
How you like me now?,1
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand,1
"Let's drink, you the one to please (yeah!)",1
