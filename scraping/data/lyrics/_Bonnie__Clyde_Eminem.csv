"(Just the two of us, just the two of us)",0
"Baby, your dada loves you",0
And I'ma always be here for you,1
"(Just the two of us, just the two of us)",1
No matter what happens,1
You're all I got in this world,1

I would never give you up for nothin',1
"(Just the two of us, just the two of us)",1
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me,1

[Verse 1],0
"C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach",0
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat,0
"Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk",1
"Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk",0
"Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'",0
"But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women",1
"That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit",0
"Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it (No)",1
"And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?",0
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (,0
Yeah,0
),0
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float,0
A,1
nd don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat,1
"It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt",1
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin',1
And spilled ketchup on her shirt,1
"Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water",0
"And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?",0
[Chorus],0
"Just the two of us, just the two of us",1
And when we ride,1
"Just the two of us, just the two of us",0
Just you and I,0
"Just the two of us, just the two of us",0
And when we ride,0
"Just the two of us, just the two of us",0
"Just you and I (See, honey)",0
[Verse 2],0
There's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell,1
A place called prison and a place called jail,1
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one,1
'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson,0
"And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)",0
Maybe when you're old enough,1
"To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya",1
"But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad",0
"Was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad",0
But I still feel sad that I put her on time out,1
"Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out",0
"I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?",0
"Take a night-night? Na-na-boo, goo-goo-ga-ga?",0
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee,0
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty,0
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water,0
"'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter",1
[Chorus],0
"Just the two of us, just the two of us",1
And when we ride,1
"Just the two of us, just the two of us",0
Just you and I,0
"Just the two of us, just the two of us",0
And when we ride,0
"Just the two of us, just the two of us",0
Just you and I,0
[Verse 3],0
"Wake up, sweepyhead, we're here, before we pway",0
We're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier,0
"Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea",0
Mama's too sweepy to hear you scweamin' in her ear (,0
Mama,0
),0
"That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry",0
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake,0
"Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (",0
Yeah,0
),0
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock,0
"Ready now, here we go, on the count of free",0
"One, two, free, whee",0
"There goes Mama, spashin' in the water",0
"No more fightin' with Dad, no more restraining order",1
"No more step-dada, no more new brother",1
"Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you love her (",0
Mommy,0
),0
"Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk",0
"But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk",1
[Chorus],0
"Just the two of us, just the two of us",1
And when we ride,1
"Just the two of us, just the two of us",0
Just you and I,0
"Just the two of us, just the two of us",0
And when we ride,0
"Just the two of us, just the two of us",0
Just you and I,0
[Outro],0
"(Just the two of us, just the two of us)",0
"Just me and you, baby, is all we need in this world",0
"(Just the two of us, just the two of us)",0
Just me and you,0
Your dada will always be here for you,0
"Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that",0
"If you ever need me, I'ma always be here for you",0
"You ever need anything, just ask",0
Dada will be right there,0
Your dada loves you,0
"I love you, baby",0
