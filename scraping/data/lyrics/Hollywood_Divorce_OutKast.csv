[Hook: André 3000],0
Starts off like a small town marriage,0
"Lovely wife and life, baby carriage",0
"Now all the stars have cars, success of course",0
"But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce",0
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne],0
And I'm a star,0
"Yea, and I don't have to go to Hollywood",0
'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on,0
I really think they're stealing from us like a sample song,0
I really wish one day we'd take it back like Hammer's home,0
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home,1
And all I got in return was a darn country song,0
This whole country wrong,0
What would you write if you just put a little ice on,1
And cut your mic on but you don't even write songs,1
"But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra",0
I'm so not sober I'm high like a Hollywood,0
"Coffee or soda, you can call me a roller",0
"Hold up, your grill's glistenin'",0
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different,0
What's the real sense of it?,0
"Bling bling, I know and did you know",0
"I'm the creator of the term, I just straightened the perm",0
"Ain't let it sit too long, they just makin' it burn",0
"And make a movie of our lifestyle, but they earn",0
Like a dead body burned on a mantlepiece,0
That's why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease,0
"And I be's the little nigga, cooler than anti-freeze",0
Defrost on your window pane -,0
Lil Wayne,1
But in Hollywood it's Litt-le Wayne,1
", don't make me none",0
So that's why I got a pre-nup,0
I do,0

"Now all the stars have cars, success of course",0
"But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce",0
[Verse 2: André 3000],0
"Yeah, Yeah",0
A is for Adamsville,1
B is Bowen Homes,0
See if I give a fuck if you like me you know I don't,0
If she ain't got a good head on her leave that ho alone,0
If she do got some good head on her let her sing a song,0
"D is for what I serve, I don't be on no curb",0
"She ain't no junkie neither, I ain't no dope dealer",0
But she keep coming back three stacks must be some crack,0
"Put that pipe in her lap, she ain't know how to act",0
"Now that I've got your undivided attention, I'm",1
Gonna say this and run under condition one,1
"Promise me you gon' stack, promise me you gon' ball",1
Promise me you'll invest three fourths of it all,0
"For what? So your kids, kids, kids can have some cheese",0
Can't get with it? Get get get get get on your knees,0
'Cause wealth is the word,0
Rich is round the corner from the curb,0
Don't like what I write? Shoot me a bird,0
[Verse 3: Big Boi],0
(Starts off),0
"Tenth grade, the way was pave for me and Dre to create",0
Like Dr. Frankenstein the arts and crafts,0
Now could we make a difference,0
Antwan Patton and André Benjamin,0
Been jammin' for you crabbing rap niggas and journalists,0
That's quick to misprint public and private business,0
Then retract back for deaf ears and think it's dismissed,0
Part two the sequel all new 'Kast,0
Just ain't the same gang of nerds on the internet,0
Slandering your name behind that screen name,0
They're lame and their life is pretty plain,0
M&M's with no nuts,1
Won't show up face-to-face straight bitch made,0
Like puppies on the nipples of a mutt,0
Address it on a case-by-case basis like the judge,0
What about these lyin' ass hoes tryin' to plot,0
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen,0
(Nigga please),0
But even she can walk we'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it,0
But God don't make mistakes must be something bigger waiting,0

"Now all the stars have cars, success of course",0
"But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce",0
[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg],0
"I do, love you but you hate me at the same time",0
"Lights, camera, action, it's game time",0
Do you take this here as your lovely wife?,0
To love her and cherish her for all your life?,0
I solemnly swear to dare share take you there,0
And me and you together baby we a lucky pair,0
"It's been a long time, we walked a thin line",0
Others say they got you but you been mine,0
As I sit back and watch all them cat fights,0
Domestic violence — is that right?,0
"But you love the Dogg, gave me the spotlight",0
"And now I'm growin' up, showin' up, blowin' up",0
I never ever thought that we would separate at all,0
But you played me like a game of football,0
"Used to feed me, need me, dress me",0
Now it's so messy straight cut out and left me,0

Hollywood divorce,1
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing,1
"Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap",1
Not even talkin' about music,1
Everything else too,1
By the time it reach Hollywood it's over,1
But it's cool,1
We just keep it goin' and make new shit,1
"Take our game, take our name",1
Give us a little fame,1
And then they kick us to the curb that's a cold thang,1
