Praying Private Ryan comes 'round,1
Sound travels at one-thousand-one-thirty feet per second,1
"Niggas in the street they want it, hurry",1
When niggas stop biting that's when 3000 starts to worry,1
A little knowledge from the college of wizard Ray Murray,1
Answer quick: do you know what desire is? (Huh?),1
"Apparently not, that's why you get what you got",1
Now answer this: do you know what fire is? (Yeah!),1
"The body of hot, the motivator of pots",1
"Snot, spit, shit are characteristics of release",1

"Look at the way you look at me,",1
I see it on your face,1
"All your hate emanates, but you still hesitate",1
"'Cause you want inside of my head, but don't know how",1
To brainwash me to be a commercial clown,1
"Fuck that, I see the way you were",1
See the way you smirk,1
I'm catching you where you work,1
God only knows all the trouble that grows,0
Deep beneath my soul dealing with you assholes,0
Can I blast those who point the finger at me,1
Who criticize and talk shit so freely,1
Fuck XXL—you're a size too small,1
I should hire Eminem so we can kill you all,1
Whether you live to talk shit about the Real,1
Then kiss my ass in person how much you love the Hill,1
I'm the outcast coming to blaze the grass,1
Outlaw due to my life that's come to pass,1
"Dré, pass me the glass of wine",1
So I can pour it over my homies grave and mine,1
For all those who fallen and answered when God was calling,0
Jump into my ragtop and get all in,0

"Your homeboy Daddy Fat Sax playin' clean-up, so it worsens",1
"People and persons on the opposite teams, oh, yes, its curtains",1
"No bullets burpin', oh, just lyrically twerking, oh",1
Making a statement when you freestyle and your mind is in a free state,1
It's kinda hard to execute when you ain't feeling it that day,1
Jumpin' the gun and rushing your flow,1
Babbling on the mikie like auctioneer,1
"Got the public's ears fucked up, can't hear",1
"Atlanta, Georgia where y'all at? (right here)",1
OutKast this Dirty South to death the Dungeon Family Camp,1

Making that music that make your neck hurt,1
And the beats that bother your back in my Cadillac,1
Six woofers and four amps,1
"Lo pro vogues on swole, with the carriage lamps",0
Diamond tucked velour pistol in my lap,0
"Come in peace, but then explode like booty traps",0
