"You Know, some things just got to be said",0
"Marathon Music, uh",0
[Verse],0
"Look, you don't a clue of what you want to do",0
"I'm busy gettin' rich, you think that I'm gon' stop for you?",0
I built this on my own and everybody know it's true,0
Still niggas act like they supposed to have control of what I do,0
"But look, they don't got a clue of what I been through",0
Nigga ain't have no trust funds or eat off no silver spoons,0
Nigga ain't have no peace inside my house until I moved,0
And I damn sure can't recall havin' no exit route in you,0
"But really, I don't got a clue of what you even do",0
And what good is a dream if you can't make yo shit come true?,0
What good is a team when everyone depends on you?,0
Hope opportunity don't knock what opportunist in yo group,0
'Cause then what you gon' do?,0
What you gon' do?,0
"'Cause if you sharin' your success and not your struggle, you's a fool",0
"Then you start to look like food, the game don't even chew",0
Eat you up and shit you out and then them critics say you through,0
"But look, they don't got a clue what you was tryna do",0
"Keepin' it one hunnid, one hunnid don't keep it true",0
But I'm gon' tell you what to do,0
Here is what you do,0
"Say, ""fuck the middle-man,"" get on your marathon and get your loot",0
"I hustle 'cause I have to, not because it's cool",0
And over time became accustomed to the bullshit niggas do,0
"Now I'm numb and it's cool, had to bounce back and regroup",0
"Hope you don't expect shit from me, 'cause I don't want shit from you",0
[Outro],0
Now I'm ballin' like I'm (Like we s'posed to),0
Livin' life like we s'posed to,0
Fuckin' bitches like we s'posed to,0
Gettin' money like we s'posed to,0
Smokin' kush like we s'posed to,0
