[Verse 1],0
Instinct leads me to another flow,1
Every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho,1
Trying to make a sister feel low,1
You know all of that gots to go,1
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule,0
"Now don't be getting mad, when we playing, it's cool",0
But don't you be calling out my name,0
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame,0
"That's why I'm talking, one day I was walking down the block",0
I had my cutoff shorts on right cause it was crazy hot,0
I walked past these dudes when they passed me,1
"One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty",1
"I turned around red, somebody was catching the wrath",1
"Then the little one said, ""Yeah me, bitch,"" and laughed",1
"Since he was with his boys, he tried to break fly",0
"Huh, I punched him dead in his eye",0
"And said, ""Who you calling a bitch?""",0

[Verse 2],0
"I hit the bottom, there ain't nowhere else to go but up",0
Bad days at work give you an attitude and you erupt,0
And take it out on me but that's about enough,0
You put your hands on me again I'll put your ass in handcuffs,0
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependency,0
I was too blind to see just how it was affecting me,0
"All I knew was you, you was all the man I had",0
And I was scared to let you go,0
Even though you treated me bad,0
But I don't want my kids to see me getting beat down,0
By daddy smacking mommy all around,0
"You say I'm nothing without ya, but I'm nothing with ya",0
A man don't really love you if he hits ya,0
"This is my notice to the door, I'm not taking it no more",0
"I'm not your personal whore, that's not what I'm here for",0
And nothing good gonna come to ya til you do right by me,1
Brother you wait and see (Who you calling a bitch?),1

What's going on in your mind is what I ask ya,0
"But like Yo-Yo, you don't hear me though",1
You wear a rag around your head,1
"And you call yourself a ""gangsta bitch""",1
Now that you saw Apache's video,1
"I saw you wildin', acting like a fool",1
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school,1
But where did all of this come from?,1
"A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya",1
Now you a wannabe... hard,1
"You barely know your ABC's, please",0
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it,0
Why you trying to jump in front of the bullet (Young lady),0
"Uh, and real bad girls are the silent type",1
Ain't none of this worth getting your face sliced,0
"Cause that's what happened to your homegirl, right?",1
(Barking with no bite!),1
She got to wear that for life,1
