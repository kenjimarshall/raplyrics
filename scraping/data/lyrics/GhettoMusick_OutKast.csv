[Chorus: André 3000],0

[Interlude: André 3000],0
Climbing out this hole (Climbing out this hole),0
With a frown on my face,0
(In the place to be) In the place to be,0
And not to be at the same time,0
[Pre-Chorus: André 3000],0
"G-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K, stay down",0
"O-U-T-K-A-S-T, just know that we won't play 'round",0

I just want you to know how I feel,1
"Feeling good, feeling great",0
How I feel,1
"Feeling great, feeling good, how are you, you?",0

"Feeling good, feeling great",0
How I feel,1
"Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?",0
[Verse: Big Boi],0
"Hot tub, bad to the bony, I'm Tony",1
"As my Grandmama Edna Mae Kearse, she showed me",1
"How to be the smooth operator, dominator",1
"In the state of Georgia, hip hop standard destroyer",1
Leave a muthafucka open like a foyer,1
"He from the dirty, now here come the paranoia",0
A lawyer couldn't object or disrespect the technique,1
"Sweat me, wipe off the sweat",1
Fight off the shit and flush the waste down,0
The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground,0
"Find my purpose on the surface of this Earth, this",0
Planet's standards trust and the purpose,0
Campaign in vain for the same lame fame,0
"You've obtained, you ought to be detained",0
"By the hip hop sheriff, locked up, no possibility",0
Of getting out because the shit you make is killing me,0
"And my ears, and my peers",0
"I hear the end is near, no fear,",1
we disappear,1
Then reappear again in a fresh new light,1
I hope it's peaceful and cloudy,1
"'Cause if it's not, we gotta fight like",1
[Pre-Chorus: André 3000],0
