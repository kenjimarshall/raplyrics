"Pocket full of boarding passes, huh",1
I don't know what city I was in last,1
But I'm out here tryna make a impact,0
Same time keep myself intact,0
"They say, ""Take it, take it easy A like it's gym class""",1
Tell me how I could?,1
"There's slaves in the world, before I die, tryna see us end that",1
"So I move fast, Ramadan",1
"Move fast, Autobahn",1
Who cares if I ever get a Grammy nom,1
"If my soul take L's, phenomenon",1
Still can't believe I get paid for this,0
"As a kid, all I did was pray for this",0
"Now I'm livin' out my dream, craziest",0
Got me really feelin' like I was made for this,0
At the same time never knew how dangerous,1
It could be when lives start getting changed to this,1
When somebody say you they favorite,1
Guess it carry some weight to it,1
"You know, cause uh",1
That's power and that's influence,1
The temptation is to use it for myself and serve somebody else,1
I'm sittin' here buggin' just rememberin' what them rappers showed me,1
"How to bag a honey, stack the money",1
They said I was a mac by the number of shorties that I could smash,1
Now I'm waitin' on that matrimony,1
Cause I've been changed up,1
Lil' homie came up,1
"It's depressin', kickin' it with dudes I used to look up to",1
"They still on that same stuff, what!?",1
[Refrain],0
"I ain't have no role models, now I gotta be one",1
"I bought the lie hip-hop sold me, man I want a refund",1
[Chorus],0
"I feel like it's the real me, feel me?",0
"Yeah, I been changed, but I'm still me",0
"What I am now, not what I will be",0
I'm tryna give life,1
But this could be the death of me,1
The death of me,1
This could be the death of me,1
"(Just trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me)",1
"Yeah, yeah, yeah",1
The death of me,1
This could be the death of me,1
"(Just trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me)",1
"Yeah, yeah, yeah",1
[Verse 2],0
"Look, mama feel like she losin' me",1
To this lifestyle that's consumin' me,1
I travel every weekend even when I'm weak man,1
You know what that to do to me?,1
"Back pain, back pain",1
"Sleepin' on planes, I'm feelin' like Bruce Wayne",1
Blackout at night on that stage,1
Man I need a Batcave just to get away,1
"Jesus retreated, woo!",1
"To speak with his Father, I know that I need it",1
My career been growin',1
But tell me where I'm goin' if my time with God is depleted,1
"God I'm sorry, I mean it",1
"All I want to do is walk with you, but",1
"My priorities wrong, I talk about you more than I talk with you",1
One of my mentors taught me whenever things get foggy,1
If you wanna grow in God it's not complicated it's just costly,1
"Gotta spend that time, currency",1
Overtime guess I learned to be,1
Strong enough to admit I'm weak,1
To meet with God all I need is me,1
2014 'bout to be different,1
I think my favorite word'll be no,1
Opportunities come and they go,1
But none of them is worth my soul,1
That's somethin' that you can't afford,1
And got me thinkin' what's most important,1
"I get kicks, watchin' grown men in line for some Jordans",1
Nowadays time is fortune,1
But chasin' fortune is all consumin',1
I feel like God's callin' dudes,1
They just wanna play Call of Duty,1
"This that Peter Pan, at the dinner table out in Never Land",1
"Eatin', can't nobody see it but me and my boys",1
That's the way I wanna keep it,1
I lost a couple friends to this new season,1
Jealousy and hate for a few reasons,1
"Used to be down, now what's up?",1
"Guess everybody around when the fun's up, yup",1
Got me feelin' isolated,1
"Women wanna holla, I just tell em' that I'm taken",1
Even if I wasn't I'd be slow for the taking,1
I'll know if they love me or the money I'm making,1
Ain't no way to really tell,1
Where somebody heart truly at,1
Bad girls comin' at me looking good,1
Showin' off they body that's a booby trap,1
"Beard low, but I never let my guard down",1
"Buddy, I ain't crazy",1
You ain't bout' to catch me slippin',1
Pull a Million Dollar Baby!,1
Me and Dre trying to eat good,1
Cuttin' out the nonsense,1
On the road trying to give life,1
But I might lose mine in the process,1
[Refrain],0
"I ain't have no role models, now I gotta be one",1
"I bought the lie hip-hop sold me, man I want a refund",1
[Chorus],0
"I feel like it's the real me, feel me?",0
"Yeah I been changed, but I'm still me",0
"What I am now, not what I will be",0
I'm tryna give life,1
But this could be the death of me,1
The death of me,1
"This could be the death of me, uh",1
"(Just trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me)",1
"Yeah, yeah, yeah",1
The death of me,1
This could be the death of me,1
"(Just trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me)",1
"Yeah, yeah, yeah",1
