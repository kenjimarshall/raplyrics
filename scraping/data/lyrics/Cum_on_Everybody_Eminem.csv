My favorite color is red like the bloodshed,1
From Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead,1
Women all grabbin' at my shish kabab,1
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve,1
(“I can't stand white people”),1
You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so,0
"Shit, I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat",0
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe,0
"I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show",0
I just remembered that I'm absent-minded,1
"Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it",1
I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit,1
"'Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit (Um, one, two)",1
I told the doc I need a change in sickness,0

"Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo",0
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again,1
That's why I write songs where I die at the end,1
'Cause I don't give a fuck like my middle finger was stuck,0
"And I was wavin' it at everybody, screamin', ""I suck"" (I suck)",0
I go on stage in front of a sell-out crowd,0
"And yell out loud, ""All y'all get the hell out now""",0
"Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up, y'all, I'm sorry",1
"(But Eminem, this is your record release party)",1
"I'm bored out of my gourd, so I took a hammer",1
And nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford,1
"Guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard",1
Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket (I ain't got it all),1
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet,1
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage (Oh),1
And if you ever see a video for this shit,1
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit,1

Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit,1
'Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy,1
So I told 'em I was Mike D,1
"They was like, ""Gee, I don't know, he might be""",1
"I told 'em, ""Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert"" (Oh really?)",1
"I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster"" (Okay)",1

"Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out",0
"'Til I started bustin' freestyles, broke out",1
"Then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick",1
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick,1
Made a couple of crank calls collect (Brrrt),0
"""It's Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?""",1
I want to make songs all the fellas dub,1
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of,0
"So just remember, when I bomb your set",1
"Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset",1
