[Chorus],0
"I know, got a feeling that I might blow",1
Even though this industry is cutthroat,1
Now I don't feel the same,0
Think these drugs drive me insane,0
"Cutthroat, swear these bitches, they be cutthroat",0
I'm so low,0
Cruising through the city with my eyes closed,0
Cause I'm losing my brain,0
Gotta keep on moving straight,0
"Over, when you say it's over I'm not sober",0
"Loner, she left me so lonely with no closure",0
Now I don't feel the same,0
Think these drugs drive me insane,0
[Verse 1],0
They want to see me live,0
And I cannot forgive,0
Think I'm really going psycho,0
Thinking that I might blow,0
And I can't let you in,0
"Baby, I can't forgive",0
Got me hanging on a tight rope,0
"It's time for me to let go, cause",0
These drugs got me thinking that I need you,0
But I don't really need you,0
It's hard for me to see through,0
But now I see the real you,1
"Like glass, I see right through you",1
"Now why you acting new new, we both know what you wanna do",0
Shorty in my phone,0
But where you at?,0
"Run off with my love, like you was a running back",0
"But now I got you running back (Ayy, yeah)",0
"Now I got you running back (Ayy, yeah)",0
[Chorus],0
"I know, got a feeling that I might blow",0
Even though this industry is cutthroat,0
Now I don't feel the same (Oh no),0
Think these drugs drive me insane,0
"Cutthroat, swear these bitches, they be cutthroat",0
I'm so low (So low),0
Cruising through the city with my eyes closed,0
Cause I'm losing my brain,0
Gotta keep on moving straight,0
"Over, when you say it's over I'm not sober",0
"Loner, she left me so lonely with no closure",0
Now I don't feel the same,0
Think these drugs drive me insane,0
[Verse 2],0
They know we them niggas,0
And that's why they hate us,0
Only worry 'bout the money,0
So no you can't phase us,0
I can't never fall in love 'cause love is full of danger,0
You were my other half and now you are a stranger,0
"Now I'm hard to reach, hard to find",0
"In my line, all the time, every night",0
"We living in a trippy life, I'm sad inside",0
"So I really don't care to fight, enjoy the high",0
And now you want back in,0
But I can't let you in,0
Now you get to watch where I go,0
Got you going psycho,0
And no we can't be friends,0
And we can't make amends,0
Now it's time for you to let go,0
I'm just someone that you used to know,0
[Chorus],0
"I know, got a feeling that I might blow",0
Even though this industry is cutthroat,0
Now I don't feel the same (Oh no),0
Think these drugs drive me insane,0
"Cutthroat, swear these bitches they be cutthroat",0
I'm so low (So low),0
Cruising through the city with my eyes closed,0
Cause I'm losing my brain,0
Gotta keep on moving straight,0
"Over, when you say it's over, I'm not sober",0
"Loner, she left me so lonely with no closure",0
Now I don't feel the same,0
Think these drugs drive me insane,0
