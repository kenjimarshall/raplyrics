[Intro: Dr. TC],0
"So, you tell me that everything just isn't going well",0
"Well, first off...",1
[Verse 1],0
My only problem is death,1
"Fuck heaven, I ain't showing no religion respect",1
"Brain damage, therapy's the only thing I regret",0
Talking to me is like a fucking body missing a neck,0
"But, I'm surprised I ain't pop off my top off",1
"Life is a bitch and my cock's soft,",1
the Glock's cocked,0
"My hands tremble, my finger slipped, the wall's red",0
"Her life is fucked, she's sad now, her son is dead",1
[Hook],1
I told her I'm her worst nightmare,1
"This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair",1
My spirit floats around in the night air,1
"Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems",1
I told her I'm her worst nightmare,1
"This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair",1
My spirit floats around in the night air,1
"Or in your daydreams, that's how death seems",1
[Verse 2],0
"When I was younger, I would smile a lot",1
"I'm getting older, getting bolder, but a wiser top",1
"Now I'm drunk driving, lap's full of Budweiser tops",1
Life is a movie and you're just a prop,0
"They begged me to stop, but I listen like deaf drums",0
"Love? I don't get none, that's why I'm so hostile to the kids that get some",1
My father called me to tell me he loved me—,1
I'd have a better chance of getting Taylor Swift to fuck me,1
"Annoying and I'm ugly, most niggas wanna punch me",1
I'm surprised the fucking doctor even touched me,1
"Feel like Humpty, you hoping that I'll fall? Fuck y'all",1
"I'm Ace, I'm parentless, odd, kinda arrogant",1
"Ignorant as fuck, offend people for the hell of it",1
"Because I am the devil, fucker, get on my level",1
"Doughnuts and keys and kick-flips, Supremes and markers",1
"My life is Ms. Mon-unique Parker, but a little darker",1
"I'll see you in a couple, OF",0
[Hook],1
I told her I'm her worst nightmare,1
"This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair",1
My spirit floats around in the night air,1
"Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems",1
I told her I'm her worst nightmare,1
"This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair",1

[Interlude: Dr. TC],0
"Tyler, here's some water, man. You seem a little tense. How's Thebe?",1
[Verse 3],0
All because a nigga just don't give a fuck,1
Parents wanna blame me all because their kid is fucking up,1
"But fuck that, you're a shitty parent, face it, suck it up",1
"That's what you should've did before that nigga bust, huh",1
Feel like I missed my little brother growing up,1
Feel like my little brother missed his brother growing up,1
"But this is Golf Wang, like he missed his family growing up",1
"I got a little taller since the last time you seen me, bruh",1
"Now I'm emo,",1
"so fuck it, I'm pouring up",1
"But I never had a drink— (Sydney, Tyler's throwing up!)",1
My nigga Jasper said if I drink and get drunk enough,1
I won't feel the feelings I be feeling when I'm sobered up,1
"But that's a fucking lie, why would he say that? I'm",1
"As emotionally straight as Travis when he--(Tyler, calm down)",1
"Don't look at me, I'm 6'5"", about to fucking cry",1
"About another guy,",1
"but this is Golf Wang, do or die",1
I finally had a family,1
"Domo's in another state,",1
and where the fuck is,0
Riley?,1
Now you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me,1
But before the co-signing and you fuckers couldn't find me?,1
Fuck that! I hope you die in a fiery death,1
"One ear I got kids screaming, ""O.F. is the best""",1
"The other ear I got Tron Cat, asking where the bullets and the bombs at",1
"So I can kill these levels of stress, shit",1
They say that I'm shock value,1
How about you hop off cock and turn volume down?,1
I haven't got around to telling my mom shit (why?),1
Cause I don't know how to...(whoa),1
"All I want is her support, but no, it's the fights at home",0
"When mommy cusses out cousin, some knifes get shown",1
"Now she's really fuckin' pissed, so the knives get thrown",1
"And hit her in her fucking neck, now her throat's all gone",1
Looking like a fucking monster from the Twilight Zone,1
Then they wonder why I stay at Travis' pad with a backpack,1
"For the whole week, full of plastic-wrapped black tees",1
And deodorant like his house is my home,1
I could live with the same hat,1
And the same flat-screen TV watching Flapjack,0
And the same,0
bacon,1
and waffles on a nice Saturday,1
Where I skate with the same fucking friends that,1
"Didn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh",1
"""Message from",0
"The GZA,",1
"oh, another one from Plain Pat""",0
"Email full of emails, I never write back",1
"Ain't kill myself yet, and I already want my life back",1
[Hook],1
I told her I'm her worst nightmare,1
"This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair",1
My spirit floats around in the night air,1
"Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems",1
[Verse 4],0
"One shot, two shots, one gun, two cops",1
I'm blowin' them flu shots,1
", couldn't kill me with two top rockers",0
You're on the side of faggots and,0
cock blockers,1
I'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches,0
"I'm Barney, dinosaur",1
Harley of a human,1
Cause I'm shrooming with the bangers and the carneys,1
You niggas can't harm me cause y'all know that,0
"We at the fuckin' Dirty like it's laundry (Tyler, calm down)",1
"Nigga, get off me",0
[Outro],0
"(Calm down, man)",0
"Fuck off me man, fuck (what's gotten into you?)",1
"I don't know, it's like I'm a different person at times",0
"Sometimes I'm fucking mad, sometimes I'm not (yeah, you...)",1
It's like I got a fucking voice in my head,0
"Telling me to do all this fucked up shit, man (yeah, what's this?)",0
"I don't fucking know, man (what's this person named then, Tyler, huh?)",0
"He tells me to do this shit, that I don't wanna fucking do",0
(what's his name?),1
Tron Cat,1
