"I saw you (and him, and him) walking in the rain",0
You were holding hands and I'll never be the same,0
Tossing and turning another sleepless night,0
The rain crashes against my window pane,0
"Jumped into my car, didn't drive too far",0
That moment I knew I would never be the same,0
"'Cause I saw you (and him, and him) walking in the rain",0
You were holding hands and I'll never be the same,0
Now here you are begging to me,0
To give our love another try,0
Girl I love you and I always will,0
But darling right now I've got to say goodbye,0
"'Cause I saw you (and him, and him) walking in the rain",0
You were holding hands and I'll never be the same,0
I saw you (and him) walking in the rain,0
You were holding hands and I'll never be the same,0
"Hey, hey, baby, how you doin', come on in here",0
Got some hot chocolate on the stove waitin' for ya,0
"Listen, first things first, let me hang up that coat",0
"Yeah, 'n' how's your day today, did ya miss me?",0
"Oh, you did, yeah, I missed you, too",0
I missed you so much I followed you today,0
"That's right, now close your mouth, 'cause you cold busted",0
"That's right, now sit down here",0
"Sit down here, so upset with you I don't know what to do",0
'n' my first impulse was to run up on you and do a Rambo,1
Whip out the jammy and flat-blast both of you,1
But I ain't wanna mess up this 3700 dollar lynx coat,0
"So instead, I chilled, that's right, chilled",0
"Then I went to the bank, took out every dime",0
And then I went and canceled all those credit cards,0
"Yeah, all your charge accounts, yeah",0
I stuck you up for every piece of jewelry I ever bought you,0
"Yeah, that's right, everything, everything, didn't fly with me",0
"Naw, don't go, you ever go, don't go looking in that closet",0
'Cause you ain't got nothing in there,0
Everything you came here with is packed up,0
And waiting for you in the guest room,0
"That's right, what was you thinking about, huh?",0
"What were you tryin' to prove, huh? You's with the Juice",0
"'n' I gave you silk suits, Gucci handbags, blue diamonds",0
I gave you things you couldn't even pronounce,0
Now I can't give you nothin' but advice,0
"'Cause you're still young, that's right, you're still young",0
"I hope you learn a valuable lesson from all this, you know?",0
Gonna find someone like me one of these days,0
"Until then, know what you gotta do?",0
You gotta get on outta here with that alley-cat-coat wearin',0
Hush-puppy-shoe-wearing crumb cake I saw you with,1
"'Cause you dismissed! That's right, silly rabbit",1
"Trix are made for kids, don't you know that?",1
You without me: like cornflake without the milk,0
"It's my world, you just a squirrel, tryin' to get a nut",0
Now get on outta here! Ah! Don't touch that coat!,0
