"New women, new clothes, new bitches, I see",0
This ain't the world for me,0
"And everything, you cop it, I can get it for free",0
"Smoke the buddha, win the day",1
Wish that I could say,0
Open up for the smile,0
Look at me like a child,0
Waving at this is ours,0
It's a very good blessing,0
Hoping that they bless 'em,0
"It's something real, yeah",0

"Man, I'm trying to see kingdom soon",1
Looking at the stars and the moon,1
Man I'm trying to get crazy,1
Man I'm trying to get wavy,1
Hold it down for my baby,0

[Verse 3],0
"Never get lost, I never get lost, in the dungeon",0
I been waiting for my options to switch,0
Trying to get out this bitch,0
But niggas won't leave for nothing,0
You know that I'm up to something,0
You know I can't deal with you,0
Promise that I speak the truth,0
I just hold it down for my youth,0
"I been wavy for days, ain't got enough on my plate",0
I wish that Woodie could stay,1
Gotta get this money today,1
I pray until we get solid,0
I'm stacking 50 wallets,0
"Look at the speakers, they knocking",0
"These nigga's hate, but they watching",0
"Now they pop my disc, I was made for this",0
Look at all the shit that we did,0
I was trying to cut my wrists,0
"So wave 'em, high",0
Until we get that fucking power,0
Fucking bitches up in Brooklyn and I'm busy smoking sour,1
