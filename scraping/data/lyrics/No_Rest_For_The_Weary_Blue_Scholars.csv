[Verse 1],0
There's no rest for the weary just another day grinding up stones,0
"Till they turn into dust, it's tough times in the rough",0
Diamonds ain't enough to cover up a corrupted and fucked up legacy of strange fruit,0
"Bloody whips and small pox, trigger-happy cops",0
Barbed wire and,0
fire water,1
",",0
y'all it don't stop,1
When the colonizer came with the cross and the sword,1
"I threw the first spear and said ""I declare war!""",1
I'm a battle-scar wearing heir apparent,1
Descendants of a long lineage of proletariat and peasant,1
So check the work ethic and the name,1
The lessons might change but the essence of the message is the same,1
[Chorus],0
So when they say anything,1
"Say ""why is it?""",1
Class is in session 'til the teacher gets a pink slip,0
I ride the rhythm imbibe a little whine talk,0
Head get the concrete inline wit' your spine,1
[Verse 2],0
I speak to find peace but it's war all the time,1
It's deep like the drive from Renton to Shoreline,1
I'm a more mindful guy ever since finding out that,1
I'm about to be a father and doubt is not an option,1
And now I can't be getting crunk and faded as often,1
So get your hands dirty cause a prayer ain't enough,1
"Boss, what cross?",1
We got crucified by buckshots,1
One million Jesuses and >Judas got his nuts off,1
Pages torn out the memory of those who remain shackled,1
In the chains of international capital gain,1
They claim civilize with they animal ways,1
"Peace to Oakland, I've never been a fan of the A's",0
But some days you can find me inscribing my,1
Soul on the page every crime has an alibi,1
Disciplined and organized is how I handle my,0
New jacks are spending mad time on their battle rhymes,1
I can't knock it if you find it entertaining,1
I rep those whose labor ain't compensated,1
So check the work ethic and the name,0
The lessons might change but the essence of the message is the same,0
[Chorus],0
So when they say anything,0
"Say ""why is it?""",0
Class is in session 'til the teacher gets a pink slip,0
"Forty to a class, no wonder we delinquent",1
Half the school district never make it to commencement,1
[Verse 3],0
I bent the spine of the track until it snaps,1
Pops working overtime and he got a broken back,1
"Got three little sisters, one brother in Iraq",0
And mom prays,0
novenas,1
to keep the fam intact,0
But the song ain't a song waiting for God to answer,1
"Brothers call me ""Dog"", they got the letters backwards",1
I'm back with a plan of attack to repossess my,1
"Name, face, and history y'all who wanna test",1
My capacity to spit caliber shit into a rhythmic lesson,1
And entertainment's a legitimate weapon,1
Igniting the cipher sessions I'm deciphering life,0
And blended both theory into practice I write,0
Vernacular and actual fact,1
Got no posturing,0
A thousand pointing fingers I defied every one of them,1
I ride for my brother who carry the burden,1
Of a future uncertain 'til the fall of the curtain,1
You better move,1
"Hold your head high soldier, it ain't over yet",1
That's why we call it a struggle,1
You're supposed to sweat,1
Check the work ethic and the name,0
The lessons might change but the essence of the message is the same,0
[Chorus],0
So when they say anything,1
"Say ""why is it?""",1
Class is in session 'til the teacher gets a pink slip,0
Crazy landlady tried to switch up on the lease,0
"If she raises up the rent again it's time to say ""peace""",0
[Outro],0
"Peace, peace and that's my piece",0
It's still all about the bullet in the belly of the beast,1
From the East my brother we came,1
The lessons might change but the essence of the message is the same,0
So when they say anything,0
"Say ""why is it?""",0
Class is in session 'til the teacher gets a pink slip,0
So keep marching 'til your feet split open,1
"""No Rest For The Weary"" Blue Scholars keep going",1
