"Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared",1
"I'm good at repairs,",0
and I'm under each snare,1
Intangible,1
", bet you didn't think, so I command you to",0
"Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable",0
"Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews",0
"Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?",0
Picture you getting down in a picture tube,0
"Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?",0
"Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero",0
Who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?,0
"Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is",0

"The essence, the basics, without it, you make it",1
Allow me to make this childlike in nature,1
"Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy",1
"I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace",1
"Every cloud and sea, ",1
you see with your eyes,1
"I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (That's right)",1
"From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies",1
"Through Russel, ",1
not his muscles,1
But percussion he provides ,1
"for me as a guide, y'all can see me now",1
"'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind",1
That's the inner,1
(Fuck 'em),1
so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor,1
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember,1
"Where the thought is, I brought all this",1
So you can survive when law is lawless (Right here),1
"Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead",0
No squealing and remember,1
that it's all in your head,1
