"I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know",1

"Do ya, do ya?",1
[Chorus],0
Or do you not think so far ahead?,1
"'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh",1
Or do you not think so far ahead?,1

"No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it",1
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho,1
"Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute",1
That's why I kissed you,1
"Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down",1

"Yes, of course, I remember, how could I forget (How could I forget?) how you feel? (How you feel)",1
"You know you were my first time, a new feel",1
"It won't ever get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive",1
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white,1
[Chorus],0
Or do you not think so far ahead?,1
"'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh",1
Or do you not think so far ahead?,1
