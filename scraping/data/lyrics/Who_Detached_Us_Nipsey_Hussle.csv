"Look, somehow I escaped the fate of this life I lead",0
"Divorced the street, she tried to kill me and my wife to be",0
"Black widow, silk sheets and a satin pillow",0
This California king loved you like a sack of indo,0
Empty patron bottles and a pack of Mentos,0
Master suite frigerator full of incidentals,0
Every day we have a ball like the blond bimbo,0
Talk to her like a shrink and fuck her like a nympho,0
And it can be as simple as it seems,0
If you never doubt yourself and learn from everything you see,0
No wishing on a star can turn your life into a dream,0
You could walk on water just don't look down at your feet,1
"Look, told this world I was a star I'm gon' need a stage",0
Cause life is short and talk is cheap so fuck what people say,0
When I was 12 a crazy lady told me lead the way,0
I shed a tear cause it was real and swore to never stray,0
"Now every second is a classic, when nothing last",0
Gotta take a moment and appreciate the fact that,0
This world is turning faster and faster,0
Once you found the the real it's hard to tolerate the plastic,0
[Chorus],0
"I ain't no Christian, ain't no Catholic but",0
I believe god gonna shine his light on everyone and never ask shit,0
I need some answers to these questions that I'm asking,0
"We used to be connected, who detached us",0
"We used to be respected, now they laughin'",0
We've turned into possessions with no passion,0
How we go from the best to less then average,0
"We used to be connected, who detached us",0
"With no collective identity, it's every man for himself",0
We need a black mafia,0
[Verse 2],0
Ruthless Crip on some stupid shit,0
To valeting at Ruth Chris in some roofless shit,0
I think too much TV is what ruins kids,0
When homosexuals act as their influences,0
We need community centers that teach the music biz,0
That way we learn to retain ownership on some Jewish shit,0
"Don't take your hand out, you build it it's more lucrative",0
And now everything that I spoke is the truest shit,0
"You get abused long enough, you start abusing shit",0
She flipped the script and now your woman calling you a bitch,0
You got some problems in the house that only you can fix,0
And if you was a kid that grew up with it even you would split,0
He told the world he was a star and he gonna need a stage,0
Cause life is short and talk is cheap so fuck what people say,0
When he was 12 a crazy lady told him lead the way,0
He she'd a tear cause it was real and swore to never stray,0
"Now every second is a classic, when nothing last",0
Gotta take a moment and appreciate the fact that,0
This world is turning faster and faster,0
Once you found the real it's hard to tolerate the plastic,0
[Chorus],0
"I ain't no christian, ain't no catholic but",0
I believe god gonna shine his light on everyone that never had shit,0
I need some answers to these questions that I'm asking,0
"We used to be connected, who detached us",0
[Interlude: Steve Jobs],0
Death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it,1
"And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life",1
It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new,1
"Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away",1
"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life",1
"Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking",1
Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice,1
"And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary",1
Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish,1
It was their farewell message as they signed off,1
"And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you",1
Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish,1
