[Intro: Jermaine Dupri],0
"Yo, yo, yo",0
"Yo, yo, yo, yo",0
Yo,0
"See, it's rare that you find people like us",0
Cause all y'all other... (look),0
Out there doing what I'm doing,0
Or try to do what I'm doing,0
"But you can't 'cause I do what I do, my way",0
What about you?,0
Huh? Huh?! Come on!,0
[Verse 1: Usher],0
I do,0
Any and everything you want to,0
"Make your girl say, ""Oooh, oooh",0
"Why is he so fly-I-I?""",0
She beeps me,1
Ever since she wanna get freaky,0
"You can get mad if you want to, do whatever you want",0
But she still gon' give it up,0
She likes it...,0
[Chorus: Usher],0
"My way, my way",1
You can't satisfy her needs,1
She keeps running back to see me do it,1
"My way, my way",1
"What I say, goes",1
And I'm in control,1
[Verse 2: Jermaine Dupri],0
"Bad ass, se√±oritas, two-seaters with kicks",0
"New kicks, all in the mix",1
"I don't turn no tricks, they turn for me",1
Catching bricks don't concern me,1
"So forget it, little midget",1
My mind on seven digits,1
"Before I pay Heaven skies a visit, now dig it",1
"I'm pulling all stops, locking down all spots",0
"Saying ""You, can't, front""",0
"So, from this day forth, you know I'm all about heat",0
And what I do be the Major League,1
That's why your girlfriend's paging me,1
And she know like he know,0
"You don't see her like I see her, so she's out the door",0
"Shotgun in my drop, having fun",1
"With the Don, system bassing, conversation",1
About how she been chasing me,0
"And facing me, saying, ""Give it to me now, baby""",0
[Chorus: Usher],0
"My way, my way",1
You can't satisfy her needs,1
She keeps running back to see me do it,1
"My way, my way",1
"What I say, goes",1
And I'm in control,1
[Verse 3: Usher],0
Don't check me,1
It was your girl who let me,1
"Take it this far, then, ooh wee!",1
Let her have it every chance that she could get,0
"What, you think you a baller?",0
"And I ain't gon' call her, clip that",0
"You can get mad if you want to, say whatever you want",0
But she still gon' give it up,0
She likes it...,0
[Chorus: Usher],0
"My way, my way",1
You can't satisfy her needs,1
She keeps running back to see me do it,1
"My way, my way",1
"What I say, goes",1
And I'm in control,1
"My way, my way",1
You can't satisfy her needs,1
She keeps running back to see me do it,1
"My way, my way",1
"What I say, goes",1
And I'm in control,1
"My way, my way",1
You can't satisfy her needs,1
She keeps running back to see me do it,1
"My way, my way",1
"What I say, goes",1
And I'm in control,1
