I can't wait to see you,0
Wanna see if you still got that look in your eye,0
That one you had for me,0
"Before, we, said our goodbyes",0
And it's a shame that we,0
Gotta spend our time bein' mad about the same things,0
Over and over again,0
about the same thing,0
Over and over again,0
"Ho, but I think, she's leavin'",0
"Aw, man, she's leavin'",0
"And, I don't know what else to do",0
I can't go on not lovin' you,0

I remember the day you left,0
I remember the last breath you took right in front of me,0
When you said that you would leave,0
I was too damn stubborn to try to stop you or say anything,0
But I see clearly now,0
And this choice I made keeps playin' in my head,0
Over and over again,0
play in my head,0
Over and over again,0
"Ho, I think, she's leavin'",0
"Aw, man, she's leavin'",0
"And, I don't know what else to do",0

"Now, that I've realized",0
That I'm goin' down,0
From all this pain you've put me through,0

I lock it down, ohh-hooo
I can't go on not lovin' you",0
