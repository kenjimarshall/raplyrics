[Chorus: Catero],0
These voices inside of my mind they will try,1
To drive me insane,1
But everything's fine if I try to remain,1
Like powder cocaine,1
[Verse 1: Evidence],0
I be fine like powder cocaine,1
"And that's a hell of a drug, and that's a hell of a saying",1
They need elephant trunks to get it off of the plate,1
"I wanna better myself, they wanna dwell in the pain",0
"I wanna better my health, no umbrella for rain",1
"And that's a hell of a bug, I wanna live in my dreams",0
"Got an ocean in mind, they wanna settle for streams",1
I wanna settle for more,0
I wanna get knocked down so I could settle the score,0
Better than before as if that was possible,1
To shake the demons of my mother in the hospital,1
Drove to a mansion and wrote this shit in front of it,0
'Cause everybody covets the comfort of us becoming it (rich),0
"And that's a hell of a drug, I caught a hell of a dream",0
"Caught a hell of a bug, fuck irrelevant things",0
I've been moving at the speed of my life,0
"Ignorant to the price, I be fine like powder cocaine",0
[Chorus: Catero],0
These voices inside of my mind they will try,1
To drive me insane,1
But everything's fine if I try to remain,1
Like powder cocaine,1
[Verse 2: Slug],0
"I never boarded your plane, but I crossed your border",0
Got a pocket of nails and we can prop these boards up,0
I caught a fish this big like I would die for your sins,0
If it would cure my boredom,0
I want knowledge of self and also everything else,0
"But the gravity helps, yeah, reality's real",0
"When I finally fell, I told my family",0
"""Well, when a battery dies it goes to battery hell""",0
"Bent, intent, inflict a dent in the cement",0
"Magnificent, brag like Sisyphus",0
Boast like the host with the most upvotes,1
I bought a spot in coach but got the bump-up hopes,0
It goes fine like the spot on my brain,0
"Put my nose in the book, from the top of the chain",0
You stood over to look like dinner and it's not a complaint,0
But I'm almost halfway out of the rain (I'm fine),1
[Chorus: Catero],0
These voices inside of my mind they will try,1
To drive me insane,1
But everything's fine if I try to remain,1
Like powder cocaine,1
These voices inside of my mind they will try,1
To drive me insane,1
But everything's fine if I try to remain,1
Like powder cocaine,1
