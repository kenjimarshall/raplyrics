[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt],0
"Promise Heron I'll put my fist up, ",1
after I get my dick sucked,0
"Quick buck, maybe a gold chain",1
"With that fuckin' flow that's-s so belittles, man",0
They tentatively tend to turn and go when I am finished,0
"Stone cold, hardly fucking with these niggas – nigga, listen",0
"The description doesn't fit, if not a synonym of menace",0
"Then forget it – in turn, these critics and interns",0
"Admittin' the shit spitted, just burn like six furnaces",0
"Writ, it affixed, learnin' them digits and simultaneously",0
"Dispellin' one-trick-pony myths, isn't he?",1
"One adolescent, fuckin' six-nigga energy",0
And crawlin' down 'fax like a rich nigga centipede,1
Crack ceramic and slap a hand out of cash account,0
"Stamp and shoutin', thrashin', these niggas done let the kraken out",1
"Crack-a-lackin' like snap, crackle, poppin' your ammo off",1
"Hide your face, and throw your flannels off, Sweatshirt, nigga",0
[Chorus: Casey Veggies & Earl Sweatshirt],1
"'87 rooftop, Bronson",1
"Whippin' hoopties, tryna boost raw chronic",0
"Brutus in that booth, double scoop, hock, vomit up
Subrocin' thud, knockin' niggas teeth-loose",0
"Bruh, I don't fuck with no cop –",0
rollin' with that flow swamp,1
Catch me over stove top – rappin' to that coke rock,1
"
Passionless in old Jive clothin', with them doors wide open
Dim the floor lights, focused ",0
"like it's nothin', 'cause it's nothin', bitch",0
[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt],0
From a city that's recession-hit,1
Stress niggas could flex metal with peddle to rake pennies in,1
"Desolate testaments,",0
tryin' to stay Jekyll-ish,1
"But most niggas Hyde, ",1
and Brenda just stay pregnant,1
Breakin' News: Death's less important when the Lakers lose,1
"It's lead in that baby food, ",1
heads try to make it through,1
Fish-netted legs for them eyes that she cater to,1
Ride dirty as the fuckin' sky that you prayin' to,0
"So here I sit, eye in the pyramid",1
God spit it like it's truth serum in that beer and then,1
"*blow* – disappear again, reappear bearded",0
"On top of a Lear, steerin' it into the kid's ear again",0
Provider of the backdrop music,1
"For the crack rock user and the mascot, Earl",1
Rawer than a skinned knee cap on a blacktop,0
"Salivary glands, lighter fluid for the matchbox",0
"Strikin' – wait, wait, who the fuck you badder than?",0
"Boy, oh boy, I'm bad as burnt – pollo off the grill and shit",1
"Spitter of the Little Nick, nimble, rickrollin'",1
"Bitch niggas pick litter,",1
"piff-blower, plus I pillage shit",0
[Chorus: Casey Veggies & Earl Sweatshirt],1
"'87 rooftop, Bronson",1
"Whippin' hoopties, tryna boost raw chronic",0
"Brutus in that booth, double scoop, hock, vomit up
Subrocin' thud, knockin' niggas teeth-loose",0
"Bruh, I don't fuck with no cop –",0
rollin' with that flow swamp,1
Catch me over stove top – rappin' to that coke rock,1

Passionless in old Jive clothin', with them doors wide open
Dim the floor lights, focused ",0
"like it's nothin', 'cause it's nothin', bitch",0
[Verse 3: Vince Staples],0
Quit with all that tough talk,1
"Bro, we know you niggas ain't about shit",1
"Come around, we gun 'em down",1
"Bodies piled, Auschwitz",1
"Bulletproof outfits, weapons concealed",0
"I'm ready to kill – so test it, all my weapons is real",0
"Sellin' thizz, couldn't tell 'em what the recipe is",0
Got 'em wishin' that they never gave these weapons to kids,0
"Cheers, send chills up spines of fat bitches",1
After shows throwin' out sandwiches,1
Niggas get it how they live and I live for money,0
"Other words, I'm gettin' money",0
"Lil Boy told me when it's time to ride, they'll send up for me",1
"Ain't nobody scarin' me, niggas ain't prepared for heat",0
"Tools hit like pool sticks, the way I cue shit",1
"If this was '88, I would have signed to Ruthless",1
"'94, would've had 'em walkin' down death row",1
"First is when the best go, hate is what the rest do",1
"Voice inside my head told me, ""Wet 'em if they test you""",1
So it's Raging Waters season,1
"That yomper big as Larry Johnson, ",1
leave your momma seedless,0
Everybody hard until it's only God they seein',0
Kitten soft but in they songs be trappin' hard as Jeezy,0
"I don't believe it, but to each his own",0
I ain't trippin' long 'cause I can reach the chrome,0
"Heat your home like Southern California Gas, police pass",0
"Tell 'em ""Free Smalls,"" off Palm with the heat drawn",1
Strapped up long as the chief of police armed,0
"Raised where the beasts are, north of the Beach",1
"A couple streets past Baby J,",0
bony niggas sprayin' K's,1
"Ruger with the pork face,",0
Jewish for the court case,1
"Here to save you niggas from the sorbet, ",1
Coldchain,1
