Honourable Court,0
[Verse],0
Alright,0
Why the fuck do I gotta remind everybody,0
When the time is finally mine,0
I've been killing rhymes for last ten years,0
"Anybody interfere be clear,",0
I'm here like,1
I don’t wanna have to be the one up in the office,1
That’s slapping the bloggers like Straight Outta Compton,1
Baseball bats like a LA Dodger,1
I ain't finna play this year,0
Gotta upgrade this year,0
Get a payday and a AK for the nay says,0
"In the race, like I feel a Tay-K this year",1
Got a big day this year,1
I ain't even the type to do it but Imma get a big chain this year,1
Just so everybody all the way in the back can see me whenever I get on the big stage this year,0
Go look at the speed on the dash and put it on the track,0
If you think I'm speaking too fast,0
"I""m about to turn everything up until the speakers collapse",0
And make her ass ji-ji-jiggle like it's Khloé Kardash,0
I brought a beaker of hash,0
For everybody here that need to relax,0
And if it’s beef I'm repeatin the past,0
"Loose lips, get blood, like a bitch on a rag",0
"I got drip like a leak in a bath, aye",0
I've been on ten since ten,1
Solo like Kylo Ren,1
Tokyo drift up that van,0
Pablo turned killa like Cam,0
"Eating penne, pink sauce like Gotti",1
Young king on the throne like Joffrey,1
"If I ain't top ten, no convo",0
"Ay, this is Hotel Diablo",0
[Outro],0
Shit,0
