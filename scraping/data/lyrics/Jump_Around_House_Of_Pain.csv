I'll serve your ass like John McEnroe,1
"If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the ho",1
"Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs",0
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms,1
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned,1
"Anyone stepping to me, you'll get burned",0
"'Cause I got lyrics, but you ain't got none",0
"If you come to battle, bring a shotgun (Shotgun)",0
"But if you do you're a fool, 'cause I duel to the death",0
"Trying to step to me, you'll take your last breath",0
"I got the skills, come get your fill",0
"'Cause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to kill",1

"I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top",0
I never eat a pig 'cause a pig is a cop,1
"Or better yet a Terminator, like Arnold Schwarzenegger",1
Try to play me out like as if my name was Sega,1
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch,0
Get used to one style and yo and I might switch,0
"It up, up and around, then buck, buck you down",0
Put out your head,1
and then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead,1
"I'm coming to get ya, I'm coming to get ya",0
"Spitting out lyrics, homie, I'll wet ya",1
