[Verse 1: Missy Elliott],0
You can put your mind to do whatever you wanna do,0
"Just tell yourself that you capable, too",0
But don't do things that ain't even cool,0
And get rid of them no-good friends that’s enablin' you,0
"Makin' you feel like you won't be nothin', your life crumblin'",0
"They talk, mumblin'",0
"You gon' be something, you’re glorious",0
"We’re no gangs, but warriors, we well-known, notorious",0
They can't stop you or block you or mock you,0
They mad ’cause you bad and they not you,0
"You fall down, but get up and skip and hop through",0
Kick down doors for others to walk through,0
"You have a purpose, to make you say,",0
"""Did I do that?"" Urkel",1
Now we callin' reality virtual,0
"This is who I am, this is me, don't let them words hurt you",0

When the sharpest words wanna cut me down,0
"I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out",0
"I am brave, I am bruised",0
"I am who I’m meant to be, this is me",0
"Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me",0

Another round of bullets hits my skin,0
"Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in",0

And reaching for the sun",0
