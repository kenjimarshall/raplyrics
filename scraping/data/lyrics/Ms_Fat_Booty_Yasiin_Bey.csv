[Intro],0
"Man, duke I was in love with this girl, duke",0
"I was tore up dog, I'm telling you man",0
"Shit is wild man, for real",0
"It's, she's from, let me tell you about her",0
[Verse 1],0
In she came with the same type game,0
The type of girl giving out the fake cell phone and name,0
"Big fame, she like cats with big things",0
"Jewels chipped, money clip, phone flip, the six range",0
"I seen her on the Ave, spotted her more than once",0
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front,0
"She spot me like paparazzi, shot me a glance",0
"In that catwoman stance with the fat booty pants, hot damn!",0
"What's your name love, where you came from?",0
"Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up",1
The swims at the Reebok gym tone your frame up,1
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?,1
"I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down",1
"Asked her to dance and she was like, ""Yo, I'm leaving now""",1
"An hour later, sounds from Jamaica",1
"She's sipping Cris straight up, skanking, winding her waist up",1
Scene 2 - my fam's throwing a jam,1
"Fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans",1
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move,1
"""Ayo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce""",1
I turned around (Say word!) it was the same pretty bird,1
Who I had priorly observed trying to play me for the herb,1
"(Yeah, that's her)",0
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together,0
I just played along and pretended I never met her,0
"How you feeling? ""Oh, I'm fine"" My name is Mos ""I'm Sharice""",0
"I heard so much good about you, it's nice to finally meet",0
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially,0
And honey love ended up sitting directly next to me,0
I'm type polite but now I'm looking at her skeptically,0
Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry,0
"Designer fabric, shoes and accessories",0
"Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fucking with me mentally",0
"We conversated, made her laugh, yeah, you know me bro",0
"Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo",0
"I'm 'bout to murk, I say peace to the family",0
"She hop up like, ""How you gon' leave before you dance with me?""",0

"She blew my whole head with that duke, I was like, word?",1
"I played it low though, I was like, yeah, aight, come on then, let's go",1
"Niggas was mad, niggas was so sick, I tell (ya)",1
"Yo, honey was so blazing she was just",1
"Yo, she looked like Jayne Kennedy, word bond, to my mother man",1
"She was that ill man, she take me to the dance floor",0
And she start whispering to me (and shit),0
[Verse 2],0
"Yo, let me apologize for the other night",0
"I know it wasn't right, but baby you know what it's like",0
"Some brothers don't be coming right, I understand, I'm feeling you",0
"Besides, can I have a dance ain't really that original",0
"We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades",0
"They playing Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist",1
Heating my blood up like the Arizona summer,0
"Song finished then she whispered, ""Honey, let's exchange numbers""",0
Scene 3 - weeks of dating late night conversation,0
"In the crib heart racing, trying to be cool and patient",0
"She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent",0
"She walked away smiling, singing Gregory Isaacs",1
"Like, ""If I don't, if I don't have you""",1
Showing me her tan line and her tattoo,0
"Playing Sade, Sweetest Taboo",1
"Burning candles, all my other plans got cancelled",0
Man I smashed it like a Idaho potato,0
"She call me at my J.O., come now, I can't say no",0
"Ginseng tree trunks, rocking the P-funk",0
"Cocking her knees up, champion lover not ease up",1
"Three months, she call I feel I'm running a fever",0
"Six months, I'm telling her I desperately need her",0
"Nine months, flu-like symptoms when shorty not around",0
"I need more than to knock it down, I'm really trying to lock it down",0
Midnight we hook up and go at it,0
"Burn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart I got to have it",1
She telling me commitment is something she can't manage,1
"Wake up the next morning, she gone like it was magic",0
"Ahh, damn it, my shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic",0
My 911's unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress,1
"Next week, Mu hit me up, I saw Sharice at the Kittie club",1
With some banging ass Asian playing lay it down and lick me up,1
What!?,0
