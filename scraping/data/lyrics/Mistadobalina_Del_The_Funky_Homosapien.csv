"Mista Bob Dobalina, won't you quit?",0
You really make me sick with ya fraudulent behavior,0
You're gonna make me flip and then an army couldn't save ya,0
Why don't you behave ya little rugrat?,1
"Take a little tip from the tabloid, because I know I'm not paranoid",0
When I say I saw ya tryin' to mock me,0
Now you and your crew are on a mission tryin' to hawk me,0
But it isn't happenin' ya fraudulent foes,0
You used to front big time now I suppose,1
That everything's cool since the style of apparel you adopted,1
You used to make fun of but now you wanna rock it,1
So you gotta kick it with the homies,1
But D-E-L is already hip to your cronies,1

"Friends can be fraudulent, just you wait and see",0
First he was my moneygrip then he stole my honeydip,0
"Mista Dobalina is a serpent, don't you agree?",1
The little two-tima resembles Aunt Jemima,1
With jeans and a dirty white hoodie,1
Seems like he wouldn't be a snake or would he?,0
Disguises come in all sizes and shapes,1
Notice the facade of the snakes,1

The way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees,0
You need to take heed and quit being such a groupie,0
Ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee,0
I neva saw a groupie like you,0
But what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew,1
But D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters,1
"So I would suggest that you try to impress Uncle Fester, Dobalina",1
Because ya don't impress me Dobalina,0
The style of dress is not the key Dobalina,0
"It's all in the mind and the heart, so you should start",0
By remembering ya gotta pay a fee Dobalina,0
