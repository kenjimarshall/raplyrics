"One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show",1
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe,1
Was the start of something good,1
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood,1
Just tryna find that hook up,1
Now everyday we looked up at the ceiling,1
"Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling",1
"Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper",1
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur,1
"Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light",1
"Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock",1
"Doing the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop",1
"Like ""Freeze!"" We making the crowd move",1
But we not making no G's and that's a no-no,1
[Verse 2: Big Boi],0
"Check it, a one-two, a one-two dope niggas in the Cadillac",1
"They call us,",1
went from Player's Ball to ballers,1
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging,1
"Niggas say mothafuck that playin, they payin, we stayin, layin vocals",1
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry,0
"""OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise""",1
"Over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly",1

"Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger",1
Looking to fill me belly with that Rally's bullshit,1
"Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled",1
"Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys",1
Smoking them White Golds,1
before them blunts got crunk,1
Chunky asses,1

passes getting thrown like Hail Mary's,1
And they looking like Halle Berry's,1
"So so fine, intertwined,",1
but we ain't sipping wine,1
"We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high",1
"Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug",1
"And my little brother James,",1
thangs changed in the hood,1
"Where I live at, them rats know,",1
"""Momma I want to sing",1
"But momma I want to trick, and momma I'm sucking dicks now""",1
We moving on up in the world like elevators,1

Got stopped at the mall the other day,1
Heard a call from the other way that I just came from,1
"Some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something ""Hey man, you remember me from school?"" ""No not really""",1
"But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly",1
"And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive?",1
"I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes",1
"From all them songs that y'all done made""",1
And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had,1
"True, I've got more fans than the average man",1
But not enough loot to last me to the end of the week,1
I live by the beat like you live check-to-check,1
If it don't move your feet then I don't eat so we like neck-to-neck,1
"Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes",1
"From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue",1
