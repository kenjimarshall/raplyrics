[Intro: Andre 3000],0
"""Okay, here we go...""",1
"Yeah, I'm afraid, like I'm scared as a dog",1
"But I've got a new song,",1
and I want y'all to sing along,0
Sing along,0
See this is the way that we walk on a sunny day,1
When it's rainin' inside and you're all alone,1
"All alone, yeah!",1
[Hook],1
'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down,0
"(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)",0
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound,0
"(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)",0
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news,0
"(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)",0
And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues,0
"(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)",0
[Verse 1: Andre 3000],0
"Take a little trip, hater, pack up your mind",0
"Look forward, not behind, then you'll see what you find",0
I caught a sucker dyin' 'cause he thought he could rhyme,1
Now if his momma is a quarter daughter must be a dime,1
"I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts, I don't use abbrevi-",0
"-ation,",0
I don't even play the radio neither,1
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather,1
"I'm a cool type of brother, but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck",0
"See ain't nothing changed, hit the stage",0
"Set a date, sucker, in battle we can engage",0
"I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you",0
"Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do",0
"With my back against the wall, crack his back, y'all",0
"Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin' hair with stylin' gel in it",0
Throw a curl in it,0
"Dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it",1
"Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote",0
And this for them niggas workin' at the airport who got laid off,0
I take my shades off,0
"If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise",0
Because the whole-whole world-world...,0
[Hook],0
'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down,0
"(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)",0
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound,0
"(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)",0
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news,0
"(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)",0

[Verse 2: Killer Mike],0
"Player, I grind, my focus is crime",0
"Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime",0
My words are diamonds dug out a mine,0
"Spit 'em, polish, look how they shine",0
"Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss",0
I catch a beat running like Randy Moss,1
Ride that bitch off like a brand new horse,0
"I'm rollin' my stone, gather no moss",1
"Mommy, I'm coming, I hope you get off",0
"Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah,",1
then talk,0
"Back, back, forth, forth",0
"Get that sailor on course, course",0
"Make that track a corpse, corpse",0
"Rap, roll, utterly rocked",0
With my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock,0
"Cadillac OutKast, just won't stop",0
[Hook],0

[Verse 3: Big Boi],0
Turn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal,0
"Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet, Pepto-Bismol",0
Need it for my stomach 'cause my tummy kinda aches,0
"Like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate",0
"Wait, back to the enemy of the state",0
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate?,0
"Debate, now even the black box hold the fate",1
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break,1
"Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this",1
"If you want to, you can dub it to your hit list",1
"I know you goin' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list",0
"When it come to this music, we stay relentless",0
Pursuing all that's pursuable,0
"Doing, God-willing, all things that are doable",0
"The only liable limitation is yourself, Dre",1
"Set it on the right and I'll set it on the left, 'cause",1
