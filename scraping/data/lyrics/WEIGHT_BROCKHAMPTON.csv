"They split my world into pieces, I ain't heard from my nieces",0
"I been feeling defeated, like I'm the worst in the boyband",0
"I ain't sleep in some weekends, tryna headline both weekends",1
"Lead my niggas, y'all sheepin', I keep the world in my hands",1
I know accounts should be deleted,1
I know some niggas should stop hitting my phone,1
Whenever they needing money or favors done,1
'Cause I'm still worried 'bout when Ashlan finna put the razor down,1
So I don't really give a fuck about what story they done spun,1
"And I ain't done (No, no)",0
Yeah (Tell something),0
"And I ain't done, you heard me?",0
"I ain't done (Yeah, I'm screaming oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)",0
I really miss the old days before the cosigns,1
I really miss them cold days before the road signs,1
I really miss when I ain't know which way I was supposed to head,0
And I was pressed because my shawty gave me cold signs,0
I was writing poems 'bout her dawg in study hall,0
And she was mad 'cause I never wanna show her off (Scared),1
And every time she took her bra off my dick would get soft,1
"I thought I had a problem, kept my head inside a pillow screaming",1

I don't wanna waste no more time,0
I'm ready to go,0
I put my life on standby,0
I can leave you alone,0

[Verse 2: Joba],0
'Cause we're born with a dollar sign attached to our temple,1
Life is a dish served cold most times,1
And all my life I've taken handfuls,1
Force-fed by the hand that feeds us,1
But not all hands created equal,1
"I stand by, waiting for something good to come",1
"In due time, the skies will split for the sun to smile",1
[Verse 3: Dom McLennon],0
My mother called me today,0
She said she thought she felt my energy a country away,0
I apologized for not calling enough due to weight,0
But couldn't tell you if I kept it in my head to decay,0
"I asked her ""Why this world love echoing hate?""",0
"She said ""Don't let those who don't know you start dictating your fate""",0
I think the hardest part of love could be rebuilding the breaks,0
Conditioned to omit them until our foundation will shake,0
It's no debate,0
"The road to peace is filled with snakes, you gotta keep your cool",1
And recognize the wolves that wanna try and leave you wool,1
"Don't let 'em treat you like a window, you know you're a jewel",1
This world is cruel and not as simple as they teach in schools,0
Sometimes you gotta step away and check your own intentions,0
And analyze if what they do can compromise your vision,0
"If people trust you, they don't need to question your decisions",0
You never needed them if they make you another villain,0
