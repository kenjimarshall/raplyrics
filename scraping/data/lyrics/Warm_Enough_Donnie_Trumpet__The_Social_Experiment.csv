[Hook: Noname],1
Who are you to tell me,1
I'm not warm enough for summertime?,1
I know that I get beside myself,1
But you don't know me like the sun,1
You've never seen my horizon,1
[Verse 1: Noname],1
If I was everything I never was,1
Drugs got me bubbly suddenly mumbling,1
Simile meant to be for you now,1
The futile go fishing for moon over roof top,1
A new style for praying to everything I ever loved,0
My black boy outer space looking like a rain child,1
But my body move like the sun,1
Go run til 'em rainbow we painted it 50 shades of grey,1
"Stones across the lake,",1
the house in the house,0
"Deceptive carnations, our wedding we announced",1
On Sunday for the holy of it,1
"Solely covet me and you, for you and I",1
Are blissfully tethered to simple redeeming,1
When sadness gets worse and we don't know why,1
Our city is bleeding for crimson,1
"I don't protest,",1
I just dance in my shadows,1
Hallow be thy empty,1
"When my name don't sing, shallow waters",0
Under bridges don't forget 'bout me,0
Who are you to love me and not call me by my name?,1
"I'm sunny, I'm sunny, just like you...",0
Noname,1
[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper],0
"Like the sun, like the sun",0
Who are you to tell me I can't love you,0
The way mothers love daughters?,0
The way Mary was closest to Joseph,0
And babies is close to The Father,0
You don't know me and love got a secret hand shake,1
And mad inside jokes,1
I could tell it’s knock knock when my heart beatbox,1
Use your inside vox,0
Who are you to tell me I don’t want you,1
The way flesh wants freedom,1
"The way greed love need, the way kings need kingdoms",1
"You don’t know what I know, what I’m capable of",1
What I slaved for and traded in favours,1
And gave up for you what I gave up for love,1
[Hook: Noname],1
Who are you to tell me,1
I'm not warm enough for summertime?,1
I know that I get beside myself,1
But you don't know me like the sun,1
You've never seen my horizon,1
[Verse 3: J. Cole],1
You like the flower that I won’t let die,1
Right before your petals start to wilt,1
I choose to give you one last try,1
"Fill your vase up with water, refusin’ to neglect you",1
"Like your father, so I promise that it won’t run dry",1
Good intentions 'cause I wanna see us both fly,1
But I often put me first and I been wonderin’ why,1
I know you probably think you’re blessed,1
To have a wonderful guy,1
And that’s the truth but at the same time a wonderful lie,1
Cause to me you’re a dime and I’m still a nickel,1
And you know niggas say that every coin got two sides,1
Well if you knew both minds not sure you’d like what you find,1
"I made mistakes, I want to tell you but can’t make up my mind",0
As I’m writing this I see a red balloon in the sky,1
And to me that’s a sign tellin’ me that these lines,1
"Were meant to be written, repentin’ in the form of a rhyme",1
"I know the Lord’s a forgiver, hope he’ll forgive me in time",1
[Hook: Noname],1
Who are you to tell me,1
I'm not warm enough for summertime?,1
I know that I get beside myself,1
But you don't know me like the sun,1
You've never seen my horizon,1
