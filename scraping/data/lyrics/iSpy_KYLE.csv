"Well maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie",1
"I know when you text me, girl, I don't always reply",1
"Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly",1
"I noticed, you think that you know shit",0
"All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it",1
"They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus",1
"That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit",1

You can come back to mine though,1
"Your friend ain't cute, but it's fine though",1
We gon' end on a high note,1
[Chorus: KYLE],0
I spy with my little eye,1
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes,1
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife,1
"Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind",1
"Oh, I spy with my little eye",1
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes,1
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife,1
"Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind",1
[Pre-Chorus: KYLE],0
"Oh I, I spy with my little eye",1
"I spy, I spy with my little eye",1
"Oh I, I spy with my little eye",1
"I spy, I spy with my little eye",1
Oh I,1
[Verse 2: Lil Yachty],0
"She said she 21, I might have to I.D. that",1
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack,1
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback,0
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins,0
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin',0
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin',0
Got my brothers on my back like the last name,1
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed,1
"Whoa, six months later I had snapped and now I'm in the game",1
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane,1
"Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screenin' out the lane",1
"Went from ""Damn this nigga lame"" to remember my name",1
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me,1
"They went to college, now all them niggas is history",1
Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth,1
"Ridin' deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy!)",1
So don't fuck with me,1
"No, lately I been livin' like luxury",1
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys,1
"And on my mother's mother, I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber",1
[Chorus: KYLE],0
I spy with my little eye,1
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes,1
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife,1
"Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind",1
"Oh, I...I spy with my little eye",1
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes,1
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife,1
"Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind",1
[Pre-Chorus: KYLE],0
"Oh I, I spy with my little eye",1
"I spy, I spy with my little eye",1
"Oh I, I spy with my little eye",1
"I spy, I spy with my little eye",1
Oh I,1
