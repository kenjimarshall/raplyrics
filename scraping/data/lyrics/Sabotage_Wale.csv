I thought it was important to go right into the booth after the arguing,0
"I think it's only right, hoarse and everything",0
"Like fuck it though, what's up",0
[Verse 1: Wale],0
Pessimism is all that she know,0
Cause every brother she go with always pick up and go,0
"I been trying to show you somethin, got a different approach",0
"Told her, ""Give me your heart; try to get you the globe""",0
"Have the world baby girl, live it up, you deserve it",0
Every time she catch feelings she go throw away the gloves,1
We go together / break up,1
We go together / break up,1
"Ain't this an insecure bitch, meanin we love to make up",0
"When we good, we good shawty",0
We don't ever make love,0
"But if I call you out your name, I bet your ready to ""uh!""",0
"You say you ready, you ain't ready enough",0
"Cause when it fall right in your lap, you be ready to get up",0
"This is her, this is it, this is sabotage love, counterfeit",0
"She the shit, she the one",0

"Cause I, am feeling this deep down in my heart",0
I'm feeling like I never want to be apart,0
"But just when it gets good, she's gone",0
And I'm left right back at start..,0
[Hook: Lloyd],1
"My girl likes to sabotage, our love yeah",0
She can only take so much more than her heart got,0
She can only live for the moment,0
Why? I'll never know it,0
Guess I'll meet her right back at start,0
[Verse 2: Wale],0
Let's roll a J and pretend we in love,0
"I've got a paper plane, it's propelling my buzz",0
"I'm trying to make a way, she never call back",0
"She's tryna fall back, cuz she say I'm all that",0
She only love me when I be ignoring,0
"When I be doing throwin it on her, shorty brushing me off",0
"I swear, I kinda feel like she's slightly bizarre",0
"Sabotage all the time,",0

"Blue ball, who fault? Mine, only cause I stick around",1
"She leave before the sun up, leave you something to think about",0
Yea and this is something to think about,0
Why people want you single every time that you got a spouse,0
"Ha, that make it hard to be faithful",0
Knowing I can go wherever and get 8 more,0
Ten more depending on where Wale going,0
Fuck it I got a few more now that my hair long,0
"It’s weird shawty, your wares showing me dead wrong",1
"You gon' miss a good thing, end up bitter alone",0

"Keep coming back for more, keep coming back for...",0
