[Verse 1],0
Tatted on my choker,0
Shoppin' sprees at Dover,0
I ain’t stopping shit till I’m 70 years older,0

Fucked two girls that looked like Tina Fey and Amy Poehler,0

"Sandals for my fam though - 3, 2, 1, takeoff",0
Jets round the world with them,0
And you know we gotta fly with the herb with them,0
"In the town, I’m a chief like turbo and them",0
Shouts for the flow G Herbo and them,1
I just got the cell phone workin' again,0
I just got the styrofoam purple again,1
Never make threats non-verbal again,0
You already know how I'm lurkin' again,0
Gunna,0
