We're from the Southside but it's Streatham over here,0
"No telling if you're selling, hold the wettin' over here",0

Most my niggas are the ones applying pressure over here,0
"Fuck assault, I can get a nigga peppered over here, whoa",1
"We wanted more, then some food on the strip or moving a brick",0
My niggas went to school with the rich and we were broke,1
Hiding crow in a Rubicon drink,1
