[Verse 1],0
"Ah, ah!",0
I'm sittin' in the crib dreamin' about Lear jets and coupes,0
The way Salt shoops and how to sell records like Snoop (oops!),1
I'm interrupted by a doorbell,1
3:52 - who the hell is this?,1
"I gets up quick, cocks my shit",1
"Stop the dogs from barkin', then proceed to walkin'",1
It's a face that I seen before,0
"My nigga Sing, we used to sling on the 16th floor",0
Check it!,0
I look deeper; I see blood up on his sneakers,0
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth,0
So I dip,0
"Nigga, is you creepin' or speakin'?",0
He tells me C-Rock just got hit up at the Beacon,1
"I opens up the door, pitiful: ""Is he in critical?""",0
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal,0
'Cause I'm a criminal,0
Way before the rap shit,0
Bust the gat shit; Puff won't even know what happened,0
"If it's done smoothly, silencers on the Uzi",0
"Stash in the hooptie, my alibi: any cutie",1
With a booty that done fuck Big Pop,0
"Head spinnin', reminiscin' 'bout my man C-Rock",0
[Chorus],0
Somebody gotta die,0
"If I go, you got to go",0
Somebody got to die,0
Let the gunshots blow,0
Somebody got to die,0
Nobody got to know,0
"That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch",1
Somebody got to die,0
"If I go, you got to go",0
Somebody gotta die,0
Let the gunshots blow,0
Somebody got to die,0
Nobody got to know,0
"That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch",0
[Verse 2],0
"Uhh, fillin' clips, he explained our situation",0
"Precisely, so we know exactly what we facin'",0
"""Some kid named Jason",0
In a Honda station wagon,0
"Was braggin', about how much loot and crack he stackin'",0
Rock had a grip so they formed up a clique,0
"A small crew, 'round the time I was locked up with you""",0
"""True indeed""",1
"""But yo nigga, let me proceed",1
Don't fill them clips too high,0
Give them bullets room to breathe,0
"Damn, where was I? Yeah",0
"Went outta town, blew the fuck up",0
D-Roc went home,0
And Jay got stuck the fuck up,0
"Hit him twice, caught him right for the Persian white",0
Pistol whipped his kids and taped up his wife (niggas is trife),0
"He figured Rock set 'em up, no question",0
Wet 'em up no less,0
"Than 50 shots in his direction"" (uhh)",0
"""How many shots?""",0
"""Man nigga, I seen mad holes""",0
"""What kinda gats?""",1
"""Hitchlinks, Kochs, and Calicos""",1
But fuck that,0
I know where all them niggas rest at,0
In the buildin' hustlin',0
And they don't be strapped,0
"Supreme in black is downstairs, the engine runnin'",1
Find a bag to put the guns in,1
And c'mon if you're comin',1
[Chorus],0
Somebody gotta die,0
"If I go, you got to go",0
Somebody got to die,0
Let the gunshots blow,0
Somebody got to die,0
Nobody got to know,0
"That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch",0
Somebody got to die,0
"If I go, you got to go",0
Somebody gotta die,0
Let the gunshots blow,0
Somebody got to die,0
Nobody got to know,0
"That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch",0
[Verse 3],0
Exchanged hugs and pounds before the throw down,0
How it's gon' go down?,0
Lay these niggas low-down,0
"""Slow down, ah, fuck all that plannin' shit",0
"Run up in they cribs and make the cats abandon ship!""",0
See niggas like you do ten-year bids,0
Miss the nigga they want and murder innocent kids,1
Not I,1
"One nigga's in my eye, that's Jason",0
Ain't no slugs gonna be wasted,0
Revenge I'm tastin' at the tip of my lips,0
I can't wait to fill my clip in his hips,0
"""Pass the chocolate, Thai!""",1
Sing ain't lie,1
There's Jason with his back to me,0
Talkin' to his faculty,0
I start to get a funny feeling,0
Put the mask on in case this nigga start squealin',0
Scream his name out: (,0
"""Ay yo, playboy!""",0
),0
"Squeezed six, nothin' shorter",1
Nigga turned around holdin' his daughter,1
