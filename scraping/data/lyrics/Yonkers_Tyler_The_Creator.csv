I'm clockin' three past six and goin' postal,1
This the revenge of the dicks; that's nine cocks that cock 9's,1
"This ain't no V. Tech shit, or Columbine",1
"But after bowling,",1
I went home for some damn Adventure Time,1
(What'd you do?) I slipped myself some pink Xannies (Yeah),1
And danced around the house in all-over print panties,1
"My mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me",1

They say success is the best revenge,1
So I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in,1
"Oh, not again! Another critic writing report",1
I'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a pitchfork,1
"Still suicidal, I am",1
"I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand",1
"I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head",1
"And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch",1
"(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G",1
I just wanna know if my father would ever like me,1
"But I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me",1
A motherfuckin' goblin,1
"(Fuck everything, man) That's what my conscience said",1
"Then it bunny-hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead",1
Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement,1
"Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit",1
Dead,1
