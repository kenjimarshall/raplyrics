[Verse 3: Ludacris],0
"Yeah, uh huh, okay",0
Once upon a time in College Park,1
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark,1
There was a little nigga by the name of Cris,1
Nobody paid him any mind,0
No one gave a shit,0
Knowing he could rap,1
No one lifted hands,1
So he went about his business and devised a plan,1
Made a CD and then he hit the block,1
50 thousand sold,1
Seven dollars a pop,1
Hold the phone,1
Three years later,1
Stepped out the swamp,1
With ten and a half gators,1
Now all around the world on the microphone,1
Leaving the booth smelling like Burberry cologne,1
Still riding chrome,1
Got bitches in the kitchen,1
Never home alone,1
And he's on the grind,0
Please let me know if he's on your mind,0
And respect you'll give me,1
Ludacris I live loud just like Timmy,1
"Fuck, have to clear these rumors",0
I got a headache and it's not a tumor,1
Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight,1
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bite,1
Hard to the core,0
Core to the rotten,0
"Jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton",1
