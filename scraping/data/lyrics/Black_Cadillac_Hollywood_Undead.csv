[Chorus: Funny Man],0
"Ride, slide, dipping low",0
"Black Cadillac, on them hundred spokes",0
"Ride, slide, smoking dro",0
"Black Cadillac, on them hundred spokes",0
What you gonna do when the shit goes down?,1
Six misfits rolling through your hometown,1
"'Cause we ride, slide, so hit the floor",0
"Black Cadillac, on them hundred spokes",0
[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears],0
When the streets grow cold and my sight turns red,0
Got that pistol grip-hold and a muzzle to your head,0
"Yeah, somebody talked, yeah, somebody said",0
"Yeah, somebody's buried, yeah, somebody's dead",0
We found my White Wolf stashed in my white ball cap,0
Got two white bros jacked and my Caddy's flat black,0
"Got the gauges all racked, devil hanging out the back",0
Now you're just a story on the cemetery track,0
"We lock and we load, we rock and we roll",0
"We cock, and we go, it's the Undead Show",0
"You know I mean what I say, better drop when we spray",0
It's too late to pray on Judgment Day,0
Hear those bells? It's the end of your life,0
"Someone's gonna live, and someone's gonna die",0
"Here comes hell, it's redemption, right?",0
"Now you're just a ghost on a cold, black night",0
[Chorus: Funny Man],0
"Ride, slide, dipping low",0
"Black Cadillac, on them hundred spokes",0
"Ride, slide, smoking dro",0
"Black Cadillac, on them hundred spokes",0
What you gonna do when the shit goes down?,1
Six misfits rolling through your hometown,1
"'Cause we ride, slide, so hit the floor",0
"Black Cadillac, on them hundred spokes",0
[Verse 2: J-Dog],0
Roll up in the spot like a live grenade,0
And every day we celebrate like a pimp parade,0
Swimming in liquor till the end of my days,0
Rolling with Funny Man in a cloud of haze,0
Who would've knew? I turn the trees blue,0
"You're sitting on the internet like, ""is this shit true?""",0
And I don't give a fuck about your bad review,0
"Till I pop out the screen with a big ""fuck you!""",0
Then hop in the backseat and get to the blasting,0
Cut down your dreams like the Hollywood casting,0
"Except this shit is real, not acting",0
"We're still murdering, so thanks for asking",0
Too damn smart to get caught up in legalities,0
"Blow you off-stage, just another fatality",0
"And, sir, you don't know that we lack morality?",0
"Fuck, suck, dick, lick, man, we nasty",1
[Chorus: Funny Man],0
"Ride, slide, dipping low",0
"Black Cadillac, on them hundred spokes",0
"Ride, slide, smoking dro",0
"Black Cadillac, on them hundred spokes",0
What you gonna do when the shit goes down?,1
Six misfits rolling through your hometown,1
"'Cause we ride, slide, so hit the floor",0
"Black Cadillac, on them hundred spokes",0
[Verse 3: B-Real],0
Semi-automatic words you heard just spray the masses,0
"Gas is lit quick, spark on a matchstick",0
"The class's classic, lyrical backflips",0
"Got you, bitches, begging for the backstage passes",0
"Rolling with the bosses, causing havoc",0
I'm just filling in because they're never gonna have it,0
"So sad, you sad bitch, so glad you have this",0
"That pneumatic, emphatic Black Cadillac shit",0
"Get your cardiac kit, where's the party at, trick?",0
"Watch me pull a hat trick, joint on a glass tip",0
Got the room loud in the valley,0
"All eyes on me, you can call me Makaveli",0
"We don't give a fuck, we never did",0
"Hit you with the thunder where you stand, that's how we live",0
"Believe me when we do it, yeah, we fucking do it big",0
"And if we show you how to win, we do it for the kids",0
[Chorus: Funny Man],0
"Ride, slide, dipping low",0
"Black Cadillac, on them hundred spokes",0
"Ride, slide, smoking dro",0
"Black Cadillac, on them hundred spokes",0
What you gonna do when the shit goes down?,1
Six misfits rolling through your hometown,1
"'Cause we ride, slide, so hit the floor",0
