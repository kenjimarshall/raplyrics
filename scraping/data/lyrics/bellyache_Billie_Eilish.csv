[Intro],0
Mind,1
Mind,1
[Verse 1],0
Sittin' all alone,1
Mouth full of gum,1
In the driveway,1
My friends aren't far,1
In the back of my car,1
Lay their bodies,1
[Pre-Chorus],0
Where's my mind?,1
Where's my mind?,1
[Verse 2],0
They'll be here pretty soon,1
Lookin' through my room,1
For the money,1
I'm bitin' my nails,1
I'm too young to go to jail,1
It's kinda funny,1
[Pre-Chorus],0
Where's my mind?,1
Where's my mind?,1
Where's my mind?,1
Where's my mind?,1
[Chorus],0
Maybe it's in the gutter,1
Where I left my lover,1
What an expensive fake,1
My V is for Vendetta,1
Thought that I'd feel better,1
But now I got a bellyache,1
(Mind),1
[Verse 3],0
Everything I do,1
The way I wear my noose,1
Like a necklace,1
I wanna make 'em scared,1
Like I could be anywhere,1
Like I'm reckless,1
[Pre-Chorus],0
I lost my mind,1
I don't mind,1
Where's my mind?,1
Where's my mind?,1
[Chorus],0
Maybe it's in the gutter,1
Where I left my lover,1
What an expensive fake,1
My V is for Vendetta,1
Thought that I'd feel better,1
But now I got a bellyache,1
"(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache, bellyache",1
"Bellyache, bellyache)",1
Maybe it's in the gutter,1
Where I left my lover,1
What an expensive fake,1
My V is for Vendetta,1
Thought that I'd feel better,1
But now I got a bellyache,1
