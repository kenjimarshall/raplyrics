"""—perfectly fine, that's fine!""",0
[Verse 1: Dom McLennon],1
"Said nigga brother, nigga brother, what you living for?",0
Is you gon' finish what you started? What you quitting for?,0
They told me God gave me a mission,0
But I'm missing the supplies to complete it,0
"I ain't the one you should read in, I'm used to being defeated",0
"So nigga, brother who you standing with?",0
I'm independent 'cause these parties never planned for this,0
"Brother nigga with a brain, unintentionally swerving in every lane",0
"The feeling's never the same, you chase what you couldn't gain",0
"I'm so accustomed to flames, I couldn't tell you what's fire",0
"Situation is dire, hear them calls from the choir",0
The disposition acquired from my position on Earth,0
"It's telling me ""Decapitate everything for what it's worth!""",0
"When I die, these words gon' need separate caskets and a hearse",0
"I don't rhyme, I freeze time and let these hands just do the work",0
"I'm in tandem with my curse, going manic since my birth",0
"See the canvas as a planet I'm commanding with my nerves, ah",0
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract],0
"Tell 'em boys, don't run from us",0
"I been down too long, cousin",0
"I been down too long, brother",0
"Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing",0
"Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping",0
Tell my boy I want a crib in London,1
"Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll",0
Build a different house with some different functions,0
"Tell 'em boys, don't run from us",0
"I been down too long, cousin",0
"I been down too long, brother",0
"Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing",0
"Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping",0
"Tell my boy, I want a crib in London",1
"Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll",0
Build a different house with some different functions,0
[Bridge: bearface],0
Try to treat man like baby,1
Feel the teeth sink in like rabies,0
"Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah",0
"Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah",0
"Boy, you know you don't look fly",1
"Them gold chains turn your neck green, bye",1
"Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah",0
"Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah",0
[Verse 2: Matt Champion],0
Nothin' different now (woo!) all around now (woo!),0
Who you keep around now? That's a big reflection,0
"Don't like how they talkin' to me, why they walkin' to me?",0
"Wear your shit upon your sleeve, stop projectin' on me",0
"Sense is your surround sound, what's your take on me?",0
"Kill the ego now, what that make of me?",0
"Angle widescreen, couple sips of Tanqueray",1
"I'ma throw a couple punches, I'ma do it anyway",0
"Chin up little son, I slide in like the macarena",1
"Lose time, pen it, style spiced up, jalapeño",0
"Supersonic, move through tunnel, two-wheel cycle, slightly",0
Silence crowd better than 9 millimeter with extended suppressor,0
"Bustin' out the function, highly comfortable",0
"Got this Martine on my body, man, my sweat lethal",1
Sweet kisses like the candy out the carnival,0
"I'ma call my own shots, hit the audible",1
[Verse 3: Joba],0
Impending death is the only sign of life,0
I'm throwing Hail Marys 'til I die,0
"Throw it up, all I have is peace of mind, throwin' up",0
"Have my wings clipped, I don't need them shits",1
Learn to fly again,1
"Fast track to last place, I swear",0
I've never been up top but I'm up here somewhere,0
"Out here, nobody can tell me shit",0
"Shit, never mind what I did back then",0
You should take a look at yourself instead,0
"Maybe you can find yourself, love yourself",0
"Here's to health and here's to wealth, all together now",0
"[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, Jaden Smith]",1
"Tell 'em boys, don't run from us",0
"I been down too long, cousin",0
"I been down too long, brother",0
"Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing",0
"Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping",0
"Tell my boy, I want a crib in London",1
"Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll",0
Build a different house with some different functions,0
"Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell ",0
"the world, I ain't scared of jum",0
ping,0
"Tell my boy, I want a crib in London",1
"Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions",0
[Verse 4: Merlyn Wood],0
Hoo! Voodoo Man,1
Momma took me to the church and I sang a hymn,1
Co-colonized Chris-ti-an,1
Now I'm losing my reli-gi-on,1
"God damn, so narcissistic this millennium",0
Fuck you and the bubble that you livin' in,0
"I don't go to church, but I'm so spiritual",0
"Pulled my life out of dirt, that's a miracle",0
"If Jesus was a pop star, would he break the bank?",1
"All these diamonds in my face, I'm shining like the day",0
"I'm living in my prime, man, what can I say?",0
"If the service is an hour, I'm an hour late",0
