[Verse 1: T-Mo Goodie],0
"Revolutionary, scary",1
"Thought provoking, spoken",1
Words of a change I don't feel but I see,1
Visions from me at 23,1
Making it free in my community,1
One day is what I live for,1
Ain't thinking about no hope no more,1
I got my boots I kick it 'til I get with,1
"Adapt and overcome, oh hum hum",1
"Go get my gun, load up for fun, and put down with the frown",1
What goes round comes round from,1
M.L.K. to Cascade,1
I know it's through them plenty figures,0
Cocaine dealers walk the wrong side,1
Up in they rides,1
Looking cleaner then I seen them the last time,1
"Then selling dimes, now its quarter ki's, stacking G's",1
In the South Indies,0
My nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles,0
Off in the hood,0
"Knowing each and every nigga selling, but can you blame",1
The fact the only way a brother can survive the game,1
The block hard to get by the dope dealing,0
"Fatal killings, and fed time, to writing rhymes",0
It ain't just the police,1
We kill each other just lost another brother,1
Fast living will get you took,1
Thinking it can't happen to you and then it do,1
Off crooked schemes it's just a dream,1
Floating face down in the mainstream,1
[Hook: Khujo Goodie],0
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream,1
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream,1
[Verse 2: Andr√© 3000],0
They swan diving,1
As if they name be Gretchen von Ivan,1
Volkoff rushin' to finish their album then you find them,1
"Lost dog paddling, backstroking, what done happened?",1
"Be rhyming ""catch of the day"" when the recipe calls for ""blackened""",1
Wrong ingredients,1
Maybe too much herbs and spices,1
Maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish,1
Of them greens,1
and it's enticing how them Jones's sing,1
So I'm gonna sing just like them to get where they at,1
"I'll even break my by back to touch their rim, if I gotta",0
My alta mater be that I follow,0
"I bite whatever that's looking tasty, water it down then swallow",1
"I hope you vomit, won't call no names cause that's not my job",1
"It just applies to whom it may concern, you know who you are",1
"But if you don't you never will, you just receive the steel",1
But then it might get ugly 'cause trust me niggas do feel,1
"The way that I felt when I wrote this,",1
but we must stay in focus,1
"We kings and queens up in this thing, get rid of all them jokers",1
"Face down, face down, face down",1

[Verse 3: Khujo Goodie],0
I let you stay in my crib,1
Now you know where I live,1
"When you was hungry, fed you a hot meal",1
Look at the hand you deal,1
"Me crudball business, niggas giving inches, so here, take a foot",1
Luck only counts in rabbit's feet and horseshoes,1
Experience is sometimes the best teacher,1
until we get our own plate,1
I hope you don't mind me eating off of yours,1
Process sm-m-moking like Jerry,1
"Meanwhile, fairies up the street sprinkling pixie dust over greenery",1
Never to attain another level of conscience,1
"Only to test, the potency",1
"Why laying here, they scheme over one another mouth to feed",0
"Deceased with a decision to make, now words shake your destiny",0
"But one miss will take it all the way, just as quick as you can say",1
"""I wish I never did what I did,"" now face this bid",1
"It was the company you kept, the many places you slept",1
"When you shouldn't have, geeking like a rat, jumping like a trap",1
Contributing to sin,1
and your nigga bitch in the club showing pink for 10,1
They got you niggas where they want you again,1
Floating face down in the mainstream,1
"That's why, that's why, that's why",1

[Verse 4: Big Boi],0
"Everybody's a player, wearing them Kangols on their head",1
"Thinking it's all about your clothes, nigga, it's all about your self",1
"The way you feel about your life, the times that you done shared with",1
"Your friends and family,",1
up and down like hoes give head,1
"To dicks, oh, six, serving them in the mix, but ain't no mystery",0
"You know the history about this clique, bitch",0
"Oh, what, you want me to call you slut?",0
Then why you fucking all them niggas letting them all up in your guts,0
But see that AIDS I'm afraid that's why I play the quiet role,0
"I lay in the cut, every month thinking I'll let that fire roll",0
"Like chimneys, and smoke signals, maybe peace pipes even",0
My partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven,1
"In the mainstream, home team banging them with these hits",0
"In the mix, flowing like some motherfucking swordfish",1
