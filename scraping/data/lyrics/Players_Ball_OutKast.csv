[Intro: Rico Wade],0
"Man, the scene was so thick",1
"Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs",1
Nothing but them 'Lacs,1
"All the players, all the hustlers",1
"I'm talking bout a black man heaven here, nahmsayin, yeah",1
[Verse 1: Andre 3000],0
"It's beginning to look a lot like, what?",1
Follow my every step,0
Take notes on how I crept,0
I's bout to go in depth,0
"This is the way I creep my season, here's my ghetto rep",0
"I kept, to say the least no, no it can't cease",0
So I begin to piece my two and two together,1
"Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better, bet",1
"I said subtract,",0
"so shut up that, nonsense about some silent night",1
"I gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right",0
I'm like no matter what the season,1
Forever chill with Smith,1
"I sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson, got my reasons",1
So tell me what did you expect,1
"You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all deck the halls",1
"Oh naw, I got other means of celebrating",1
"I'm getting blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waiting",1
I made it through another year can't ask for nothing much more,1
"It's OutKast for the books I thought you knew so now you know, let's go",0
[Hook : Sleepy Brown],0
All the players came from far and wide,1
"Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides",1
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day,1
"When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day",1
[Verse 2: Big Boi],0
"Halle-lu-jah, halle-lu-jah",1
Y'know I do some things more different than I used to,0
"'Cause I'm a player, doing what the players do",1
"The package store was closed, okay my day is ruined",1
"This is ridiculous, I'm getting serious, I'm getting curious",1
"'Cause the house is smelling stank, the chitlins old as bitches",1
I made no wishes cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back,0
Getting tipsy off the nog and,1
high as hell off the contact smoke,1
They having a smoke out in my back seat,1
They passing herb rewinding verses 'cause it's in the air,1
"I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hitting switches",1
'Cause I'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches,1
"I'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe",1
'Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five,1
It's just another day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me,1
Grab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me,1
"'Cause it's like that, yeah",0
"Forever pimpin', never slippin', that's how it is",0
[Hook: Sleepy Brown],0

[Verse 3: Big Boi],0
Ain't no chimneys in the ghetto so I won't be hanging my socks,1
on no chimney,0
"I'm fit as a tick, fix me a plate,",0
I got the remedy,1
Some greens and that ham,1
", not",0
"Don't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smoking rocks",0
"I got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon",1
"Just to let you niggas know in '93, that's how we coming",1
"So ho ho hoes, check my king-ass 'fro",1
"The gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um",1
[Verse 4: Andr√© 3000],0
"It goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then,",1
now we bend,0
The corner in my Cadillac,0
My heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat,0
"I'm leaning back, my elbow's out the window",0
"Coke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?",1
"We roll deep, we dip to Underground, see a lot of hoes around",1
I spit my game while waiting countdown,1
"A five, fo', a three, two, here comes the one",1
"A new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one",1

Here's a little something for the players out there hustling,1
Getting down for theirs,1
"From East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar",1
"You know, niggas worldwide",1
"Down, for theirs",0
