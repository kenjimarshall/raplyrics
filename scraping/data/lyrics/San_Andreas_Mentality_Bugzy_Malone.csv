[Intro],0
Bugzy Malone,0
You know?,0
Let me take them back,0
Watch this,0
[Chorus],0
And when I look back shit's changed,0
I remember sitting playing my computer games,0
San Andreas had me feeling I could rob a bank,0
And drag a man out of his car with my bare hands,0
Marijuana had me sitting on the clouds,1
So my perception was foggy,1
I'm not saying I was proud,0
To have a name in the bits,0
Before I ever spat a bar,0
"I made the Ninja go sick, before I ever drove a car",0
[Verse],0
"Year nine, we had a nine",0
It wasn't mine,0
Fidz held up a shizzer and got time,0
A year down the line,0
I'm in a good position,0
The hood knows I'm a banger so I started getting high,0
And Fidz got out of jail,0
I looked him in his eye,0
"And I could tell that wasn't my nigga, it made me wanna cry",0
He made me feel little,0
For him I woulda died,0
But from the day he dissed me I just wasn't on his side,0
So I tried to stop blazing and strengthen my mind,0
I just wished that Darkee woulda stayed on my side,0
Then come a stroke of luck,0
I'm sitting in the dock,0
My San Andreas mentality had fucked me up,0
And now they're tryna lock me up,0
My mummy left the courtroom crying so I'm looking at the man that brought me up,0
No we're not the same colour,0
I love him like a dad,0
And even though I diss him he's the only thing I had,0
So I just hope that he forgives me for the violence,0
I was in a bad place,0
Seen the devil a couple times,0
Starred death in the face,0
"I remember sitting in that sweatbox, feeling out of place",0
"While everybody's shouting, I was picturing my mum's face",0
Then we arrived at that jail,0
The atmosphere was different,0
"Yeah I'd seen a police cell, but I'd never seen a prison",0
"I was only seventeen, in a terrible position",0
"And you wonder why, I've got a defensive mechanism",0
"Listen, I don't condone any of my past",0
All I know is I was young and living fast,0
"Four months down the line, I had the wing on smash",0
"'Cause I put on a size, no sign of a moustache",0
And then they let me out,0
What a beautiful day,0
Cuh my future looked bright but the sky was grey,0
"Hah, trust my mummy to be twenty minutes late",0
"I've just been released, left hanging at the prison gates",0
And then they pulled up,0
My little sister jumped out,0
Mummy got emotional,0
We hugged for like five whole minutes,0
"On the road home, I was feeling stone cold",0
'Cause I had a vendetta,0
I'm talking an unfinished business,0
I'm a road guy now,0
"Hah, I'm certified",0
"Done jail, represented, held down the bits",0
I never sold mine out,0
But I'm about to set the pace,0
And you could see it in my face I was alone guy now,0
"Look, I hit the road, seventeen with a vision",0
"Even though I'm still a teen, I'm like a man upon a mission",0
Told my Marjay I'm about to use my intuition,0
I told Darkee I'm about to try and make a million,0
"It's a new day, and jail's just a thing of the past",0
Fidz was chilling with Darkee they was moving kinda fast,0
"Darkee had the gold chopper, Fidz had the same design",0
And I was sitting in that bedroom thinking when am I getting mine,0
Then me and Fidz had an altercation and I swear he could see it in my face,0
"I watched him run a mile, no one's taking my place",0
That's a vendetta settled now I'm in a better place,0
"So I started hitting gym, and I was hitting those bags",1
Plus I'm moving like Tyson 'cause I wanted to be him,1
"I was bobbin' and weavin', left couple man bleeding",1
But I lost determination when my coach ended up leaving,1
So I'm back on the streets,0
"Eighteen with ten grand cash, four grafters",0
And these times I had a moustache,0
"And I'm big now, and in my mind I'd completed the game",0
"I had the car, the Superbike, the bracelet and the chain",0
"But then I slowed down, how much money roll out",0
"Couple nigga's sold out, I was moving slow, now",0
I'm sitting in my bedroom with the curtains closed just feeling depressed,0
I'd written ',0
Hip-Hop Heavy Metal,0
' just to get shit off my chest,0
[Chorus],0
And when I look back shit's changed,0
I remember sitting playing my computer games,0
San Andreas had me feeling I could rob a bank,0
And drag a man out of his car with my bare hands,0
Marijuana had me sitting on the clouds,0
So my perception was foggy,0
I'm not saying I was proud,0
To have a name in the bits,0
Before I ever spat a bar,0
I made the Ninja go sick before I ever drove a car,0
