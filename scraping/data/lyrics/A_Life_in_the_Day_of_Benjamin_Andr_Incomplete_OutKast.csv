[Verse],0
"I met you in a club in Atlanta, Georgia",1
Said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album,1
"You looked at me like, ""Yeah, nigga, right""",0
"But you gave me your number anyway,",0
you were on the talcum,1
Powder,1
—,0
how's about them oranges?,1
Moved away from home to school with big plans,0
"By day, studied the history of music",0
"By night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance",0
To get your pants was a Mission Impo–ssible,1
"We were both the same age, but I",1
"Suppose wasn't on the same page, but in",1
"The same book of life,",1
so I'd page you when,1
I felt you that were getting off of work,1
Or either when you're on your way to school,1
We started hanging like Ernie and Bert,1
"And in my idle head I'm thinking, ""Cool""",1
Just when I think I'm going down your shirt,1
You're hiking up your skirt now,1
The events that followed had me volley,1
If your hometown would be heaven or hell,1
The angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best,1
Therefore hard to tell,1
You'd dropped me off by the Dungeon,1
"Never came in, but I knew that you were wondering",0
"""Now are these niggas in this house up to something",0
"Selling crack sack by sacks so they could function?""",0
"W-W-W-Well, yes and no",0
"Yes, we were selling it, but no, it wasn't blow",1
Cook it in the basement then move it at a show,1
"Then grab the microphone and everybody yelled, ""Ho!""",1
"Meanwhile, the video starts playing",0
"BET, college radio, and a van",0
Packed full of niggas with a blunt in their hand,1
"And one in their ear, you know what I'm saying",1
"But, I kept your number in my old phone",0
Got a new chip flip with the roam-roam,0
So it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits,0
But I promised I would call you when I got home,0
"But, when I got home, I never did",0
"By the time I did, heard that you had a kid",0
"By some nigga in Decatur who replied, ""See you later""",0
"When he got the good news; that's life, shit",0
"Now, I'm nineteen with a Cadillac",0
My nigga had a Lex with the gold pack,1
"Got a plaque, but I'm living with my pop-pop",1
So I got a Glock,1
and a LoJack,0
You kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw,1
And never said much 'cause half of what he saw,1
Was so far from that place you wanna be,1
"That words only fucked it up more, follow me",1
Are you starting to gather what I'm getting at?,1
"Now if I'm losing you, tell me, then I'll double back",1
"But keep in mind, at the time ""keep it real"" was the phrase",1
"Silly once said now, but those were the days",1
"When Spring Break, and Daytona, and Freakniks",1
Made you wanna drop out of college and never go back,0
"Move to the South, but that ain't a Kodak",1
"Moment,",1
on went myself and Big Boi,1
"Well, you knew him as 'Twan",1
"That's right, you were around before this shit begun",1
When 'Twan had a daughter and,1
Sorta was made to mature before the first tour,1
We hit the road like Jack,1
Laughed and cried and drive it back with some Yak,1
"Girls used to say, ""Y'all talk funny, y'all from the islands?""",1
And I'd laugh and they'd just keep smiling,1
"""No, I'm from Atlanta, baby, he from Savannah",1
",",0
maybe,1
"We should hook up and get tore up and then lay down, hey, we",1
"Gotta go because the bus is pulling out in thirty minutes""",1
"She's playing tennis, disturbing the tenants",1
"15-love, fit like glove",1
Description is like fifteen doves,0
In a jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost,0
"Making one woozy in the head and comatose, agree?",0
"Enough about me, how's about you? How's the lil' kid?",1
She was about two the last time we spoke,1
I hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink,1
'Cause I'd start the second album off on another note,1
"Now, that note threw some niggas in the hood off",1
"But see, I'd balled out, and 'fore I'd fall out",1
I'd slow my Lac down to a nice speed,1
The brain was that fried egg I might need,1
New direction was apparent,1
"I was a child looking at the floor, staring",1
So changing my style was like relief for the primitive beast,1
"Yes, I was on the rise, yeast was the street",0
"To make bread, never primary concern",0
Just to hop on these beats and wait my turn,0
"I'd meet Muslims, gangstas, bitches, rastas",0
"And macaroni niggas, imposters",1
So on a trip to New York on some beeswax,0
I get invited to a club where emcees at,1
And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head,1
Similar to the turban that I covered up my dreads with,1
Which I was rocking at the time,1
When I was going through them phases trying to find,1
Anything that seemed real in the world,1
"Still searching, but I started liking this girl",1
"Now you know her as Erykah ""On and On"" Badu",1
"Call Tyrone on the phone, ""Why you",1
"Do that girl like that, boy? You ought to be ashamed""",1
The song wasn't about me and that ain't my name,1
"We're young, in love, in short we had fun",1
"No regrets, no abortion, had a son",1
"By the name of Seven, and he's five",1
"By the time I do this mix, he'll probably be six",1
"You do the arithmetic, me do the language arts",1
"Y'all stand against the wall blindfolded, we throw the darts",0
To poke you in the heart and take you from the start,0
To when luxury transportation meant a MARTA card,1
Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays,1
"Mama or her daddy let her borrow the Benz, because she's smart",1
Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor,0
And he sells you that Rabbit that's been sitting in his yard,0
"You fix it up, you trick it out, you give it rims, you give it bump",0
You give it all your time because that's all you can think about,0
And that's as far as I got,0
(*music fades*),0
[Radio Interview],1
"And that's as far as I got, and where I wanted to go",1
Knowing the whole summer that's all you could think about,1
Even though if you cut it off and start that bitch up,1
"You need a jump, like your need and your want to grow",1
And you change all the time,1
So that Rabbit that you thought about that whole summer,1
"The next summer, you didn't want that Rabbit no more",1
You wanted something bigger and better,1
"""So the summer passed and now the Rabbit's old?""",1
"Right... right, so now you want a Cadillac...",1
