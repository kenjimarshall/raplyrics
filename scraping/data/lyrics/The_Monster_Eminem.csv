[Intro: Rihanna],1
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed,1
Get along with the voices inside of my head,1
"You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath",1
"And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy",1
[Verse 1: Eminem],1
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek,1
"Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey",1
Wanted to receive attention for my music,1
"Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me",1
"For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways",1
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated,1
"When I blew, see,",1
but it was confusing,1
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf,1
"Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam",1
"Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee",1
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet,1
It was like winnin' a used mink,1
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink,1
"I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep",1
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith,1
"But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm—",1
[Chorus: Rihanna (Bebe Rexha)],1
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed,1
Get along with the voices inside of my head,1
"You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath",1
"And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy",1
"Well, that's nothin'",1
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh),1
"(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)",1
"Well, that's nothin'",1
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh),1
"(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)",1
[Verse 2: Eminem],0
"Now, I ain't much of a poet",1
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment,1
And don't squander it,1
‘cause you never know when it all,1
"Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'",1
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from,1
"Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders",1
"No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders",1
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!,1
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder,1
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen,1
‘Cause I need an interventionist,1
To intervene between me and this monster,1
And save me from myself and all this conflict,1
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it,1
"My OCD's conkin' me in the head,",1
keep knockin',1
"Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'",1
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin',1
"Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—",1
[Chorus: Rihanna (Bebe Rexha)],1
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed,1
Get along with the voices inside of my head,1
"You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath",1
"And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy",1
"Well, that's nothin'",1
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh),1
"(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)",1
"Well, that's nothin'",1
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh),1
"(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)",1

"Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that",1
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian,1
"But until then, drums get killed and",1
"I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and",1
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track,1
Give every kid who got played that,1
pumped-up feelin',1
And shit to say back to the kids who played him,1
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children,1
But if one kid out of a hundred million,1
"Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!",1
"It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back",1
"In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that",1
"Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack",1
Maybe I need a straightjacket,1
"Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!",1
"It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—",1
[Chorus: Rihanna],1
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed,1
Get along with the voices inside of my head,1
"You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath",1
"And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy",1

(Get along with) Get along with the voices inside of my head,1
"(You're tryin' to) You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath",1
"(And you think) And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy",1
"Well, that's nothin'",1
