[Verse 1: Jay-Z],0
Fox Brown..,0
"Yeah, Jay-Z, what",0
"I keep it fresher than the next, bitch",1
No need for you to ever sweat the next bitch,1
"With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit, indeed",1
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me,1
You get the keys to the Lexus with no driver,1
You got your own '96 somethin' to ride,1
"And keep your ass tight up in Versace, that's why",1
"You gotta watch your friends, you got to watch me, they connivin'",1
"Shit, the first chance to crack the bank, they try me",1
All they get is 50 cent franks and papayas,1
From the village to the telly,1
Time to kill it on your belly no question,1
Had more black chicks between my sheets than Essence,1
They say sex is a weapon,1
"So when I shoot, meet your death in less than 8 seconds",1
Still poundin' in my afterlife,1
"Laughin', my shit is tight, who you askin', right?",0
[Chorus: Foxy Brown & (Jaz-O) with ​​Jay-Z​​],1
Ain't no nigga like the one I got,1
(No one can fuck you better),1
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot,1
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers),1
Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone,1
"​​​Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah hah​​​",1
(Tell the freaks to find a man of their own,1
"Man of their own, man of their own)",1
[Verse 2: Jay-Z],0
"Yeah, yeah, yeah",0
"Fresh to death in Mo-schi-no, coach bag",0
"Lookin' half black and Filipino, fakin' no jacks",1
Got you a beeper to feel important,0
Surroundin' your feet in Joan & David and Charles Jourdan,0
"I keep you dove, but love",0
You know these hoes be makin' me weak,1
"Y'all knows how it goes, B, and so I creep",1
I've been sinnin' since you been playin' with Barbie and Ken and,1
You can't change a player's game in the 9th inning,1
The chrome rim spinnin' keeps them grinnin',0
So I run way the fuck up in 'em,0
And wrinkle they face like linen,0
"I play hard until they say ""God",0
"He's keepin' it real, Jigga stay hard.""",0
"Lord, don't even trip, shit, I never slip",1
"Nigga, get a grip, what you don't see is what you get",0
"Weapons concealed, what the fuck y'all feel",0
When you niggas play sick we can all get ill,0

"Ha, ha, right, right",0
"Yo, ain't no stoppin' this, no lie",0
"Promise to stay monogamous, I try",0
"But, love, you know these hoes be makin' me weak",0
"Y'all know how it goes, B, so I stay deep",0
[Verse 4: Foxy Brown],1
"What up, boo? Just keep me laced in the illest snakes",0
"Bank rolls and shit, back rubs in the french tubs",0
"Mackin' this bitch, wifey nigga",0
So when you flip that coke,0
Remember the days you was dead broke,0
"But now you style and I raised you, basically made you",0
"Into a don, flippin' weight, her-on and shit",0
You know the pussy is all that,0
"That's why I get baguettes, 5 carats and all that",0
"From Dolce Gabbana to H Bendel, I'm ringin' bells",0
So who the player? I still keep you in the illest gators,0
Tailor-made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscin',0
On how I fuck the best and shit,0
Especially when I'm sippin' Baileys,0
Don't give a fuck about how you move with them other mamis,0
"I push the Z, eatin' shrimp scampi with rocks larger than life",0
"Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was",0
I got you frontin' in Armani sweaters,0
"Before this rap shit, when you was in leathers and bullshit Berettas",0
And E classes with Mo in the glasses,0
Shows in Cali with all the flavor suede Bally's,0
Now all your mens is up in your Benz's,0
"High post, I swear you be killin' me, playin' inside my pubic hairs",0
I never worry about them other chicks,0
'Cause you proved who was your wiz,0
When you was spendin' that bitch,0
"I took a little when you was up north, your commissary stay pilin'",0
How you livin' large on the island?,0
"All them collects have me vexed, but when you come home",0
Knew I was comin' off with half of them checks,0
Now we on the rise,0
Your diamond mami with the slanted eyes,0
"Holdin' this grip, cocked the En Glee-Kay and shit",0
"Fucks no, I see half of that dough",0
"Made you into a star, pushin' hundred-thousand-dollar cars",0
