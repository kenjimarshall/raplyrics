[Pre-Chorus: Logic],0
I've been on the low,1
I been taking my time,1
I feel like I'm out of my mind,1
It feel like my life ain't mine,1
(Who can relate? Woo!),1
I've been on the low,1
I been taking my time,1
I feel like I'm out of my mind,1
It feel like my life ain't mine,1
[Chorus: Logic],0
I don't wanna be alive,1
I don't wanna be alive,1
I just wanna die today,1
I just wanna die,1
I don't wanna be alive,1
I don't wanna be alive,1
I just wanna die,1
And let me tell you why,1
[Verse 1: Logic],0
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it,1
"I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic",1
"And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it",1
I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it,1
I never had a place to call my own,1
"I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone",1
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?,1
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine,1
[Pre-Chorus: Logic],0
I've been on the low,1
I been taking my time,1
I feel like I'm out of my mind,1
It feel like my life ain't mine,1
(Who can relate? Woo!),1
I've been on the low,1
I been taking my time,1
I feel like I'm out of my mind,1
It feel like my life ain't mine,1
[Chorus: Logic],0
I want you to be alive,1
I want you to be alive,1
You don't gotta die today,1
You don't gotta die,1
I want you to be alive,1
I want you to be alive,1
You don't gotta die,1
Now lemme tell you why,1
[Verse 2: Alessia Cara],1
It's the very first breath,0
When your head's been drowning underwater,0
And it's the lightness in the air,1
When you're there,1
Chest to chest with a lover,1
"It's holding on, though the road's long",1
And seeing light in the darkest things,1
And when you stare at your reflection,1
Finally knowing who it is,1
I know that you'll thank God you did,1
[Verse 3: Logic],0
"I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'",1
I know you're the reason I believe in life,1
What's the day without a little night?,1
I'm just tryna shed a little light,1
It can be hard,1
It can be so hard,1
But you gotta live right now,1
You got everything to give right now,1
[Pre-Chorus: Logic],0
I've been on the low,1
I been taking my time,1
I feel like I'm out of my mind,1
It feel like my life ain't mine,1
(Who can relate? Woo!),1
I've been on the low,1
I been taking my time,1
I feel like I'm out of my mind,1
It feel like my life ain't mine,1
[Chorus: Logic],0
I finally wanna be alive,1
I finally wanna be alive,1
I don't wanna die today,1
I don't wanna die,1
I finally wanna be alive,1
I finally wanna be alive,1
I don't wanna die,1
I don't wanna die,1
[Outro: Khalid],1
"Pain don't hurt the same, I know",1
The lane I travel feels alone,1
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out,1
And I see my tears melt in the snow,1
But I don't wanna cry,1
I don't wanna cry anymore,1
I wanna feel alive,1
I don't even wanna die anymore,1
Oh I don't wanna,1
I don't wanna,1
I don't even wanna die anymore,1
