"Man, have you ever really wondered",1
Like why are we here? What the meanin to all of this?,1

"Sometimes life can keep you down, with your face all in the dirt",0

"Big, slide into the mode, time to drop a load",0
My life is going downhill like some cardboard in the snow,1
"My bank account is frozen, I",0
Don't think that I can get out this hold,1
Feel like the figure four leglock,1
Like the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked,0
"I can't move, I can't eat, I can't even breathe",0
Can't even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds,0
"No trees, no P's to ease the stress of everyday living",0
But homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they living,0
"The unforgiven or the unwilling, live a life of sinning",0
And expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginning,0
Butâ€”what about repentance?,1
What about detention?,1
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?,1
What about repentance?,1
What about committing the same sin,1
Over and over again and again and ah..,1

Why are we here? Huh? Huh? Huh?,0
Please tell me - what are we here for?,0

[Verse Two: Big Boi],0
"Life, is nothing but a dream, so peaceful and serene",0
Unless you're being evil then you on the devil's team,0
Wide receive what you want to believe,1
But soon you'll have to sew those bad seeds,0
"Please, any man can ask to get a pass",0
Or a cleansing of sin to grant another chance,0
Perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel,0
Talk to the coach or break out the huddle,0
Whatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle,1
'Cause he who lives in the upper room is never gullible,0
As you survey the syllables and sentences,0
The question that I'm merely trying to pose is as simple as me saying,0
What about repentance?,1
What about detention?,1
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?,1
What about repentance?,1
What about committing the same sin,1
