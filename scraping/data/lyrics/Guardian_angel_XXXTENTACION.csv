[Verse: XXXTENTACION],0
"Listen close, what is this?",1
Is it heartbreak?,1
Is it truly what it feels like?,1
What it sound like?,1
What is truly at the essence?,1
Sharp teeth in the chest,0
Cancer all in the breast,0
Of the beaten and bruised,0
Feelin' like a pawn to the greed of these fools,0
But I never been a piece of the evil,0
In the womb of these fake fuck niggas,0
"With they masks up, presume",0
"I'll be telling, if I got a load, I swear I resume",0
On my conquest,1
For the key to the chest where my mind slept,1
And the love in my heart is a cancer,1
And I spread it through the wall as an answer,1
To the cries of the dead and the vanquished,1
"The depressed and the lost and the damned, it's",1
"Preservation of the peace, an ideal world",1
"Never lonely when you flowin' through my mind, girl",1
"I apologize, 'cause I couldn't see the pain in your damn eyes",1
'Cause a nigga made you leave with your heart in between different pains,1
Couldn't see ya when ya ain't cry,1
[Outro: XXXTENTACION],0
I guess I'm at a loss for words,1
"To feel so close to someone, and for them to be gone the next day",1
I guess you never realize how permanently damaging that is,1
