[Intro],0
Uh-huh uh huh uh,0
Gee-gee-geyeah,0
"Peeping, watching, streets",0
You boys are soft like bread,1
Uh-huh uh huh uh,0
Live from Brooklyn,0
Uh-huh uh,0
The streets is watching,0
"Check it, check",0
"Uh-huh uh, check",0
[Verse 1],0
"Look, if I shoot you, I'm brainless",1
"But if you shoot me, then you're famous",1
What's a nigga to do?,1
"When the, streets is watching, blocks keep clocking",1
"Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake",0
"Can't ignore it, that's the fastest way to get extorted",1
"But my time is money,",1
"and twenty-five, I can't afford it",1
Beef assorted like Godiva chocolates,1
"Niggas you bought it, I pull the slide back and cock it",0
"Plan aborted, you and your mans get a pass",0
"This rhyme, you're operating on bitch time",0
"Y'all niggas ain't worth my shells, all y'all niggas",0
"Trying to do is hurt my sales,",0
and stop trips to John Meneilly,1
The type to start a beef then run to the cops,0
When I see you in the street got one in the drop,1
When I'd rather be on tour getting a hundred a pop,0
Taking pictures with some bitches in front of the drop,0
The streets is watching,0
[Chorus],0
"When the, streets is watching",0
Blocks keep clocking,0
"Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake",0
Can't ignore it,0
[Verse 2],0
Now it's hard not to kill niggas,0
"It's like a full time job not to kill niggas, can't chill",0
The streets is watching you,0
When you froze your arms,1
Niggas wanna test you when your gun goes warm,1
"Can't get caught with your feet up, gotta keep your heat up",1
Sweet niggas running 'round swearing shit is sweeter,0
"Once you're tagged lame, the game is follow the leader",0
"Everybody want a piece of your scrilla, so you gotta keep it realer",0
Kidnap niggas wanna steal you,0
"Broke niggas want no cash, they just wanna kill ya",0
"For the name, niggas don't know the rules",0
"Disrespecting the game, want you to blow your cool",0
"Force your hand, of course that man's plotting",0
"Smarten up, the streets is watching, it's on",0
[Chorus],0
"When the, streets is watching",0
Blocks keep clocking,0
"Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake",0
Can't ignore it,0
[Verse 3],0
My street mentality: flip bricks forever,0
"Know me and money, we like armed co-defendants, nigga we stick together",0
Shit whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground,0
Hustle harder 'til secret indictment time came around,0
Now you can look up and down the streets and I can't be found,0
"Put in twenty-four hour shifts but, that ain't me now",0
"Got a face too easy to trace, niggas mouths got slow leaks",0
"Had to hire a team of workers, couldn't play those streets",0
"See out of space like Mercury, you jerking me? Hectic",0
Had to call upon my wolves to send niggas the message,0
It said this: 'Let's play fair and we can stay here,0
I'm trying to transform you boys to men like daycare',0
"Ay there's money to be made and, niggas got the picture",0
"Stopped playing with my paper and, we got richer",0
"Then hard times fell upon us, half of my staff had warrants",0
The other half in the casket lay dormant,0
I felt like life was cheating me,0
For the first time in my life I was getting money,0
But it was like my conscience was eating me,0
Was this a lesson God teaching me? Was he saying that,0
I was playing the game straight from Hell from which few came back?,0
"Like bad coke, pimp or die, was my mind frame bad?",0
Was niggas thinking simplify was turning cocaine crack?,0
"Ain't a whole lot of brain to that, just trying to maintain a stack",0
And not collide like two trains that's on the same track,0
"But, get my life together like the oils I bring back",0
"In the bottom of the pot where the, water gets hot",0
Got my transporter take it across the border then stop,0
To set up shop with a quarter of rock,0
"Here's the plan: for three straight weeks, niggas slaughtered the block",0
"But you know the game is food, it fucked up me and my dudes",0
"One drought can wipe a nigga out, faster than the cops",0
"And this unstable way of living just, had to stop",0
"Half of my niggas got time, we done real things",0
By '94 became the subject of half of y'all niggas rhymes,0
Public apologies to the families of those caught up in my shit,1
But that's the life for us lost souls brought up in this shit,1
"The life and times of a demonic mind, excited with crime",0
And the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind,0
"I figured, ""shit, why risk myself I just write it in rhymes",1
"And let you feel me, and if you don't like it then fine?""",1
The mind state of a nigga who boosted the crime rate,1
So high in one city they send National Guards to get me,1
"Shit, bitch, who's fucking with that? The streets",0
