[Verse 1],0
Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4,1
"Jockin' the freaks, clockin' the dough",1
Went to the park to get the scoop,1
Knuckle-heads out there cold-shootin' some hoops,1
"A car pulls up, who can it be?",1
A fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G,1
He rolled down his window and he started to say,1
It's all about makin' that GTA,1
[Hook],0
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard,1
"You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card",1
"Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit",1
"Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit",1
[Scratches],0
"Yo, man!",0
Get the fuck out!,1
Pump that bass!,1
"Mothafucker, say what?",1
[Verse 2],0
Donald B's in the place to give me the pace,1
He said my man JD is on freebase,1
The boy JD was a friend of mine,1
'Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal an Alpine,1
Chased him up the streets to call a truce,1
The silly cluckhead pulls out a deuce deuce,1
Little did he know I had a loaded 12-gauge,1
"One sucka dead, LA Times front page",1

"Yo, Leroy!",1
"Beer drinkin', breath stinkin', sniffin' glue",1
[Verse 3],0
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill,1
So I went to a place where my homeboys chill,1
The fellas out there makin' that dollar,1
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala,1
They greet me with a 40 and I started drinkin',1
And from the 8-ball my breath started stinkin',1
Left to get my girl to rock that body,1
Before I left I hit the Bacardi,1
Went to her house to get her out of the pad,1
Dumb ho said somethin' that made me mad,1
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe,1
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave,1
"She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?",1
"Reached back like a pimp, slapped the ho",1
Her father jumped up and he started to shout,1
"So I threw a right cross, cold-knocked him out",1

"Who do you think you are, Mr. big stuff?",1
Rock this mothafucker like Three the Hard Way,1
[Verse 4],0
"I'm rollin' hard, now I'm under control",1
Then wrapped my 6-4 around a telephone pole,1
"I looked at my car and I said ""Oh, brother.""",1
"I throw it in the gutter, and go buy another",1
"Walkin' home, I see the G ride",1
"Now Cat is drivin', Kilo on the side",1
"As they busted a U, they got pulled over",1
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova,1
Cat got beat for resistin' arrest,1
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess,1
Now G is caught for doin' the crime,1
Fourth offense on the boy he'll do some time,1

L.A. playa,1
Big Drum Beater,1
[Verse 5],0
"I went to get them out, but there was no bail",1
The fellas causin' a riot in the county jail,1
Two days later in the municipal court,1
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart,1
"""Disruption of the court,"" said the judge",1
"On a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge",1
Baliff came over to turn him in,1
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin,1
"He yelled out ""Fire!"", then came Suzy",1
The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi,1
Police shot the girl but didn't hurt her,1
Both upstate for attempted murder,1
