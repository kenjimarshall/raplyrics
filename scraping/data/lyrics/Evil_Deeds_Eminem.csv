"Lord, please forgive me for what I do",1
For I know not what I've done,1
[Hook],0
"Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do",1
I just never had the chance to ever meet you,1
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be,1
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds,1
[Verse 1],0
Momma had a baby and its head popped off,1
"Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off",1
"But Momma don't want me, the next thing I know, I'm gettin' dropped off",1
"Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off",1
"Ring-ring-ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors, on their front porch",1
"Their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch",1
"But they didn't want me neither, so they left me on someone else's lawn",1
"Else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn",1
"'Til somebody finally took me in, my great aunt and uncle, Edna and Charles",1
"Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, they were the ones who were left in charge",1
"My elementary, they'd gang up on me and sing this song",1
"Sing this song, sing this song, sing this song, sing this song",1
It went a little something like,1
"""Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb",1
"Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn""",1
"Momma why do they keep sayin' this? I just don't understand, understand",1
"And by the way, where's my dad?",1

[Verse 2],0
"Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly",1
"Predominantly-white, predominantly black. well, what about me?",1
"Where does that leave me? Well, I guess that I'm between predominantly both of 'em",1
"I think if I hear that fuckin' word again, I'ma scream",1
"While I'm projectile vomitin'; what do I look like, a comedian to you?",1
"Do you think that I'm kiddin'? What do I look like, some kinda idi...",1
"Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that;",1
why am I so misunderstood?,1
"Why do I go through so much bullshit? It's such bullshit, it's tush mull bish",1
"""Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin' about his millions",1
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in,1
"And the dad that he never had, and how his childhood was so bad",1
"And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife, how they go at it",1
"Man, I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it",0
"I can't imagine it. That little rich, poor, white bastard",0
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank and take a bath in it,0
"Man, if I only had half of it""",0
"Shit, if you only knew the half of it...",0
Haha,0

[Verse 3],0
"Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds",1
Please release me from these demons,1
"I never had any of this shit planned, Mom, please believe",1
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn,1
Never got the chance to say I'm sorry,1
Now look at all the pain I caused,1
"Dear Santa Claus, why are you not comin' this year again?",1
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?,1
Everything could have been so perfect,0
But life ain't a fairytale. I'm about to be hoisted up in the air,0
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere,0
I don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel,0
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel,1
"Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round",1
"Here we go now, do-si-do now, curtains up, the show must go n",1
ow,0
"Ring-around-the-rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now",0
"But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame was supposed to be",0
Where's the switch I could just turn off-and-on? This ain't what I chose to be,0
"So please, God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on",1
"'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone",1
[Hook],0
"Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do",1
I just never had the chance to ever meet you,1
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be,1
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds,1
"I said, Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do",1
I just never had the chance to ever meet you,1
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be,1
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds,1
"(Evil deeds, evil deeds, evil deeds)",1
