[Chorus],0
Mama say I got trust issues,0
I be feelin' like Jesus,0
She wants me to be her man,0
"I can't baby, I would break you",0
"Baby, I would not lie to you",0
I'd be careful if I were you,0
"I'm the one, but you might be the two",0
I'm not that liable,0
"Call me, pull off, skr-skr-skr-skr",0
Smoking that a-la-la-la,0
Give me that ah-ya-ya-ya,0
"Call me, we can pull off, right now, right now-now",0
"And when this top starts to drop, baby look in the sky and grab a star (Bang)",0
[Verse 1],0
These bitches love Turbo and I love the purple,0
"I ball, Tyrese Gibson, baby boy, you look so fertile",0
"These bitches love Otto, their mouths be wide open",0
"Been gettin' it since snot nose, I was open and then I closed",0
"These bitches love Chief Lo, but I'm not so sweet though",0
"And she is a freak though, I put her to sleep though",0
"These hoes love Almighty, like Disney loved Miley",0
"Her boyfriend is spying, she's like, ""you have to hide me""",0
"These bitches love me, that's all I can see",0
"I'm so obsessed with me, I be all I can be",0
"I don't see brown or white, all I see is green",0
"To count all this cash, I might need a team",0

[Verse 2],0
"Ooh, my car so retarded, the bitch just farted",0
"Pulled off like skrt, VIP access, I ain't gotta park it",0
"All these darts on me no Walmart, will never fuck with Target",0
"And I'm sipping, but I can't stop, I can't be hardened",0
"These bitches love Big Gucci So, but I'm no rooty tooty though",0
Don't want to talk so that's all you can know,0
"Row row ya boat, that's all you can roll",0
I'm stuffing these cones like an audience close,0
And I'm not really an American though,0
But I'm somewhere in the Madigan dough,0
But I ain't walk around like a mannequin though,0
Now yo bitch on the way,0
She want this on me,0
"But she's listening, can a bitch hold me?",0
"You can be lactose, still can't shit on me",0
"Do the whole 200 on dash, with a 150 on me",0
