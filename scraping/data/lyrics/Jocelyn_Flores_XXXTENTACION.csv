"I know you're somewhere, somewhere",1
"I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on",1
"I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing",1
"I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on (I'll be feeling)",1
[Verse: XXXTENTACION],0
"I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain",1
"I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change",1
"Suicidal, same time I'm tame",1
"Picture this, in bed, get a phone call",1
Girl that you fucked with killed herself,1
That was this summer when nobody helped,1
"And ever since then, man, I hate myself",1
"Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic",1
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in,1
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin',1
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions,1
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time,1
Memories surface through the grapevine,1
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot,1
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up,1
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up,1
[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Shiloh Dynasty],0

"And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb",1
"I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on",1
"And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb",1
[Outro: Shiloh Dynasty],1
"I know you so well (I know you, girl)",1
"I mean, I can do better than he can",1
I've been pretty—,1
I know you so well,1
