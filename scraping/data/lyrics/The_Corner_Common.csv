Memories on corners with the fo's,1
and the mo's,1
"Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes",1
"Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose",0
"To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows",0
"In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls",1
"Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo'",0
"With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves",0
"They shoot the wrong way, cause they ain’t knowin' their goals",0
The streets ain’t safe cause they ain’t knowing the code,1
"By the foes I was told, either focus or fold",1
"Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors",0
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls,0
"Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don’t roll",0
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole,0
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove,0
"The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove",1
On the corners,1
[Hook: Kanye West],1
I wish I could give you this feeling,1
I wish I could give this feeling,1
On the corners niggas rob or kill,1
"And dying just to make a living, huh?",1
[Spoken Word: The Last Poets],1
"We overstated, we underrated, we educated",0
The corner was our time when time stood still and,0
Gators and snakeskins in,0
Yellow and pink and collared blue,0
Profiles glorifying them,0
[Verse 2: Common],0
"Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right",0
"Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes",1
"So they can keep sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right",0
"Desires of street life, cars and weed types",0
"It’s hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like",0
"The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like",0
"Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype",1
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right,0
"It’s steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like",0
"Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like",0
"G's with three stripes, seeds that need light",0
"Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife",0
"The corner, where struggle and greed fight",1
We write songs about wrong ‘cause it’s hard to see right,0
"Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light",1
"Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites",0

"The corner was our magic, our music, our politics",0
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries,0
Broke out on different corners,0
Power to the people,0
Black power,0
Black is beautiful,1
[Verse 3: Common],1
"Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers",1
"As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists",1
"The dirt isn’t just fertile, it’s people working and earning this",1
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is,1
It’s so hot that niggas burn to live,1
"The furnace is, where the money moving, the determined live",1
"We talk shit, play lotto,",1
and buy German beers,0
It’s so black packed with,0
action that's affirmative,1
The corners,0
