[Intro: André 3000],1
Niggas in the point ain't changed,0
Niggas in the point ain't changed,1
Yeah...,0
[Beat switch],0
[Verse 1: André 3000],0
"A nigga ready from the get-go (Blaow, blaow, blaow)",0
"Y'all hear my shit go, it's Andre",1
Can yo' punk ass come out to play?,1
"Stay in your little hole, then coward duck your head",1
"You don't know who you be fucking with, you's better off",0
"Dead is what I say, best run the other way",0
"In case of physical breakdown, y'all can break now",0
"My kitchen full of heat, if you can't take the temp",1
Make yourself exempt,1
Pussy footing around don't be getting y'all nowhere but stuck,1
"Nowhere to duck, bullets fly, niggas die",0
"By getting blasted, how drastic",0
They got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do,0
I got the nerve to serve you up just like a waiter do,0
"But naw, I take that back, that's my problem",0
Turning and walking away,0
This ain't gon' work when they be robbing,0
"As long as Big Boi's still living, never standing by my lonesome",0
"Step up, nigga, if you want some",0
[Chorus],0
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang,1
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane,1
"It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies",0
(East Point),1
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint),1
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang,1
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane,1
"It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies",0
(East Point),1

[Verse 2: Big Boi],0
"Well, nigga, you softer than silicone used to pump up tits",1
It's that nigga down in the Dungeon with them playeristic hits,1
I'm quick to stop a sucka flow like menopause at 50,1
"Original ghetto bastard, so now I makes a switch",0
"I used to sell dope, but in 1994",1
I'm making Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik,1
But see these voices in my skull has got me reminiscing,1
About the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens,1
She had me making better grades to make a better life,1
"But I never had no love or respect, 'cause we's gon' be alright",1
I ran the streets and broke my curfew 'cause I gave a shit,0
I carried guns and butcher knives 'cause I was steadily in the mix,0
"Yeah, it was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now",0
"I'm at the end of my street, so it's time to take my stand now",0
I call the wild because it's time to take the streets,1
"So if you ain't got the vertebrae or big enough nuts, retreat",1
I'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal,1
"Just an international playa, coming through your stereo",1
[Chorus],0
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang,1
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane,1

[Verse 3: André 3000],0
3-5-7 to your forehead,0
"There'll be mo' dead 'cause I'm a pro, kid",0
"But Lord forgive me, I gots to keep my Milli right Vi-near me",1
My nine be doing fine until these niggas wants to clear me,0
"Off my street, but in my hood-hood, they hollering ghetto",0
"Don't got no neighbors, they hit the pipe and never let go",0
But I feel for them like Chaka Khan feel for you,1
"Ain't shit that we can do but rest in peace, pour a brew",0
"On the concrete, remember when we ran deep?",0
Remember at the party when we served them niggas dandy?,0
"They know not to test us, test me, do me, try me",1
"Tripping with that drama, my Beretta's right beside me",1
One is in the air and one is in the chamber,1
"Y'all ask me what the fuck I'm doing, I'm releasing anger",1
"Quick to dodge danger, I'm taking it one day",0
"At a time, I got the fattest dimes around my way",0
"You can sway with Andre, I'll take it to the Ho-Jo, bitch",0
"Just to let you know, yeah",0

[Verse 4: Big Boi],0
"It's on my friend, on the road again, I'm traveling",1
Do more than 65 on 85 off in my Cadillac,1
"I got that nigga Dre, he riding shotgun",1
And got my pump under my seat,0
In case these youngsters wanna have some fun,0
"I'd do it if I have to, busting caps with this, a heater",1
"Load it clip up after clip, I'm packing my gauge, if I feel it",1
"The Glock, the gat, the nine, the heaters",1
"See, I be busting caps like my amp be busting speakers",0
So how do you figure that Big Boi be scared to blast you?,0
"You 'posed to be the quickest draw, but man, I hail 'em faster",0
"1-2-3, you need to think about the future",0
Before I shoot your ass and dilute your blood with lead,0
"From my hollow tips, I'll send you to an early grave",1
"You fucking slave, you better try another way",0
To take me out is truly something difficult,0
Don't even run up on me unless you want your brain broke,0
"I'm out of bullets, letting loose my last clip",1
I'ma kick you in your ass and your nigga getting pistol whipped,1
"Yeah, that's how I do",0
"You know that's how I do, you know that's how I do",0
[Chorus],0

[Outro: Big Boi],0
"Yeah, and it don't stop and it don't quit, to the motherfucking",1
"Organized Noize, PA, Goodie Mob, Big Gipp and all the niggas",1
Around the East Point way,1
College Park is really on the map,1
We coming around Atlanta and the niggas are really strapped,1
With the motherfucking guns and the motherfucking Glocks,1
"The heaters, the gats, nigga, don't fear it and it don't stop",1
