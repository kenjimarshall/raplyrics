[Verse 1: Backbone],0
"From front to back street, listen, we on a mission",0
"To get right, workin' street corner in the midnight",0
"Picture the scene, these fiends with fire",0
"Ten dollar dreams, scheme, for a sack of that, believe that",0
I'm wit' whateva like Wheatstraw,1
Stuck servin' my cocaine raw,0
"Drop sixty-two off the brick, jump back",0
"Twenty over, now that's mo' money to get",0
"Slick, we fin' to lick on this corner without gettin' caught",0
"But time, keep a sleepin' and money gettin' short",0
Plus that crooked cop Brock think we blow slangin' (fuck him),1
That why he ride through the hole with the do' swangin',1
"But I make moves, shake them tricks up out they shoestrings",0
Be more precise when we do things,0
"'Cause life is like shakin' the dice, but I buck back twice",0
"Like five-deuce, fo'-trey, okay",0
[Hook: Backbone],0
I'm strictly stressin' dirty dirty,0
Gon' represent it to the T-top,0
Born and bred up on the street top,0
Get to the money and the sweet spot,1
"And forever hollerin' ""Hootie Hoo!"" when we see cops",1

[Verse 2: Big Boi],0
"Shit, cops and robbers, niggas be bound to get them dollars and cents",0
They get in a slump like baseball players when they short on they rent,1
"Anything goin', you ain't knowin' how much money you spent",1
But in the real world you surrounded by these ladies and gents,0
Who hang around you 'cause you be buyin' all the weed and all the chicken,0
"Feedin' everybody, smokin' 'em out",0
When you was broke though they was missin',1
"Now you ridin' 'bout fo' deep, startin' to tear up your suspension",1
"And your baby mamma on child support, my fault, forget to mention",0
You don't even have a checking account wasn't thinking about no pension,1
I used to work at Steak 'N' Ale,1
", Old Gold off in the kitchen",0
"Had determination and graduated, now I got the whole rap world fascinated",0
I wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so I made it,1
"Continue to sell dope, it's payin' the bills so you gon' do it",1
But legislation got this new policy: three strikes and you're ruined,1
Now where your crew at? Yeah,1

[Verse 3: Cool Breeze],0
"Ay, me and my buddy on the cut and they know we servin' 'em slabs",0
"We better watch what we doing, and look out for Joe Nab",0
And quit re-ing up and standing on this same old block,0
Before our gangsta-ass partner get both of us shot,0
Niggas talkin' 'cause they making some flow,0
But still ain't did nothin' that ain't been done befo',0
"You can't be trying to showcase, just put it down for your spot",0
And improvise and work with that little you got,0
So I think when I finish selling my last sack,0
"I'ma take some of this money, go and give some back",0
"'Cause people won't forget about the time you gave, knowmsayin'?",0
And start thinkin' 'bout a path to pave,0

[Outro: Big Boi],0
This is uh… a lil'… tune that we composed back on the first album,0
"I know a lot of y'all, uh, playas out there thought we wasn't gon' come back at y'all with this thang here, but… it go a lil' some' like this!",0
