Look how my ice hittin' off of my wife beater,0
Hop out on you stuntin' in a white creature,0
Sixteen ounces in the two liter,0
M16 in the two seater,0
In Barney's gettin' designer by the boat load,0
"Don't stress over me baby girl, smoke dope",0
And the only thing I'm dodgin' is popo's,0
And I'm in love with the dope smokes,0
[Verse 1],0
I love runnin' through the bands,0
"You ain't Glo, then we givin' niggas tans",0
"You want the flow, I can give a nigga a hand",0
"How these shells fly, I'm givin' niggas fans",0
"Up in Hermes, hand the clerk big bands",0
Big choppa on me 'cause I got big hands,0
Big racks on me like I'm wearin' big pants,0
"If my car go vroom, then my shit madd",0
"I ain't Jesus, you won't fuck around with my feast",0
And your beauty queen fuckin' around with a beast,0
"Automatic on me, fuck around we'll squeeze",0
"110, 55, do that shit with ease",1

"Throwin' money from the top, it's fallin' on the floor",0
"I'm gon' send some shots, that's all a nigga know",0
"And how many I squeeze, it's off how far a nigga go",0
Runnin' through these pounds to show how much a nigga smoke,0
"I ain't even got to say it, you know where a nigga from",0
"You can have a .30 on you, we takin' niggas guns",0
"When I was up in school, I was takin' niggas lunch",0
And this ice on me dedicated to a gun,0
They say I do the most,0
I be like on folks,1
Now let's have a fuckin' toast,1
'Cause I made it through the smoke,1
