Niggas elope wit ski slopes and fall like avalanches,1
"Tootin' like it's cool: he's a fool,",1
and I can't just,1
Sit around and watch those nose membranes flame,1
My ends is loose and you can't stop that rain,1
When it starts to fall,1
"Lookin' like Ms. Pac-Man, hammers and Vogues and cat-man
I'm speaking about these pros 'cause you know nothing bout that, man
The nigga the B-I-G is high and fly like ValuJet
You thinkin' about the beatin', this my ends is never met, nigga",0
"Black man, white man, Jew man, ain't no joke",1
Remember me and my cousin used to sit up on the porch,1
And talk about when we get older; now we up against the ropes,1
"Yeah, they kickin' niggas door down, 'cause it ain't no dope on the streets",1
"And a quarter pound of feet weed, that's all a nigga like me need
Talkin' about that Southern sess, nigga, you all up in that mess
But never shall you test, and never shall you quit
Runnin' up on me with that fuck shit will get you nothin' but dead, nigga",0
[Hook: Sleepy Brown],0
Be careful where you roam cause you might not make it home,1
"(In the junction, in the junction)",1
Don't you dare ever get lost or get caught up in that sauce,1
"(Junction, junction)",0
To all you players play ya brims and you hustla chrome ya rims,0
'Llac and pimps and macks I love the corners that you bend,0
"Y'all, yes, yes, uhh",0
"(Junction, junction)",0

"Uh, well I'm drankin' on 'gnac while I'm dippin' off in that 'llac ('llac)",1
The junkies around my way are always smokin' up on that crack,1
Be layin' them College Park hoes flat on they backs (backs),1
Livin' the life of pimps steadily makin' this paper stack,1
"Niggas don't understand the master plan, crumble yo' herb, man",1
"'Til they start kickin' the do' in, then we ready to blast them",1
"Out (Out) like 'Kast ('Kast), we 'bout to crash (crash)",1
"So mayday, may Dré, knock 'em up off they ass boi",1
"We struggle like fat hoes just to get things that those
People got we forgot they always gonna keep a plot
Right up they sleeve you won't believe they deceive like weave
Thieves can't break in your crib and leave in that good life too
So gimme me and then I'm straight, as eight-oh-five
See, blindfolds can't cover three eyes
We wise to the fact so we attack with what we know
Heaven is the only good life, so what you strivin' fo'?",0

"Well, like flip-flops and football socks",1
A nigga be rockin' the mic like birthdays,1
"Lil' Jon and Sercy, so are you worthy?",1
I'm callin' yo' ass a flawed pimp,1
Yappin' about this crew you run wit',1
Bankhead bouncin' to that dumb shit,1
So what mo' can you come wit'?,0
"Yeah, they can bite, but cannot be us
They can come and pick up little slang but cannot see us
You ought to be ashamed, trying to fit in my adidas
So Run like D.M.C. is me and, no, don't got no heater",0
"Well, we zippin' around the corner in that golden stankin' Lincoln",1
I got my heat up under my seat,1
Just in case these youngsters tryin' to take it,1
Pullin' the pistol on another black man was never the plot,1
But sometimes my brothers lose theyself and try to take my spot,1
"They come like black stallions in the night
Usually around fo' or five is when they figure the time is right
When you good and sleep; I couldn't sleep until I seen it
'Wit my own eyes, 'til they come over the hill—surprise",0
