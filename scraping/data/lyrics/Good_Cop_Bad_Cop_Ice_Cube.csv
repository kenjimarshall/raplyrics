[Intro],0
Turn me loose,0
Break 'em off some,1
Yeah,0
[Verse 1],0
"Good cop, good cop rollin' with that bad cop",1
"What'cha doin', boy? Turn in that blood clot",1
"Buck shots, they fly through drug spot",1
Robots can give a damn who the fuck shot,1
"Clean cop, clean cop, fuckin' with that dirty cop",1
Don't act like yo' ass never heard of that,1
"Clean cop, clean cop rollin' with that mean cop",0
Still tryna act proud as a peacock,0
You know that mean cop might need a detox,1
Mothafucka tried to blow me out my Reeboks,0
But I swing like Jack and the Beanstalk,0
Chop 'em down when these bitches try to lock me down,0
Hit the ground hit the turf,0
Warp the earth,0
"Cube kidnap your mind, Patty Hearst",1
Bust a verse that'll make yo' ass hit reverse,1
Kill the curse that was placed on the universe,0
West Coast warlord blacker than the Black Knight,0
Fuck a black and white when they ain't actin' right,0
"Good cop, good cop filling out your report",1
Bad cop asking you to distort,1
Bad cop asking you to lie in court,1
Send another young brother up north,1
Send another young sista off course,1
While these mothafuckas chill on the golf course,1
[Chorus],0
Black police showin' out for the white cop,1
White police showin' out for the black cop,1
Black police showin' out for the white cop,1
White police showin' out for the black cop,1
[Verse 2],0
Lazy cop fuckin' with that crazy cop,0
Always bragging 'bout the new case he got,0
Do-or-die cop with that suicide cop,0
"Tell-the-truth cop, with that you-a-lie cop",0
"Are you fuckin' high, cop? Don't even try cop",0
Ain't no mothafuckin' drugs up in my spot,1
All you find in my closet is the high tops,0
And my mothafuckin' tickets to the skybox,0
"Hold up, nigga, I'm a rider",0
"You's a roll-up, yep the controller",0
Make me mad that's when I get swole up (Don't touch me),0
The Incredible Hulk is bipolar,0
Come out the cuffs knock off the rust,0
Throw my hands (What's up?) up you still wanna bust,0
The Trojan horse is full of excessive force,1
When they try to get aggressive nigga off the porch (C'mon),0
[Chorus],1
Black police showin' out for the white cop,1
White police showin' out for the black cop,1
Black police showin' out for the white cop,1
White police showin' out for the black cop,1
[Verse 3],0
"Good cop, good cop, where is your dignity?",1
Where's your empathy? Where is your sympathy?,1
"Bad cop, where's your humanity?",0
"Good cop, is that just a fantasy?",0
"Hell on that nigga, snitch on that bitch",0
"Truth be told, mothafuck the blue code",0
Fuck the po-po actin' like Deebo,1
Already know Craig'll let the brick go,1
Black Lives Matter is not chit chatter,0
"'Cause all they wanna do, is scatter brain matter",0
A mind is a terrible thing to waste,1
A nine is terrible in your face,1
The mace has a terrible fuckin' taste,1
The pen is a terrible fuckin' place,1
The kings all hate the fuckin' ace,1
The judge sabotaged my fuckin' case,1
Racist motherfucker,1
[Outro],0
Black police showin' out for the white cop,0
White police showin' out for the black cop,0
