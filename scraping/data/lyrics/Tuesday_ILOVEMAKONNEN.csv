[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen],0
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday,1
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey,1
Club goin' up on a Tuesday,1
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey,1
Club goin' up on a Tuesday,1
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey,1
Club goin' up on a Tuesday,1
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey,1
[Verse 1: Drake],1
Squad goin' up,1
Nobody flippin' packs now,1
I just did three in a row,1
Them shows is back-to-back to back now,1
Put the world on our sound,1
You know PARTY and The Weeknd,1
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time,1
To party on the weekend,1
Tell Gelo bring the juice,1
We about to get lit,1
Fill the room up with some tings,1
One night off and this is it,1
Always workin' OT,1
Overtime and out of town,1
Shit is crazy back home,1
It kills me that I'm not around,1
I think we gettin' too deep,1
Shit I'm talkin' might be too true,1
Upstairs I got Xans in an Advil bottle,1
I don't take them shits but you do,1
So I got 'em for you,1
I don't need the pills,1
I'm just gon' have another drink,1
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend,1
I'll look back on this and think,1
How we had the club going up,1
[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen],0
Goin' up on a Tuesday,1
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey,1
Club goin' up on a Tuesday,1
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey,1
Club goin' up on a Tuesday,1
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey,1
Club goin' up on a Tuesday,1
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey,1
[Verse 2: ILoveMakonnen],0
Workin' Monday night,1
On the corner flippin' hard,1
Made at least three thousand,1
On the boulevard,1
I've been workin' graveyard,1
Shifts every other weekend,1
Ain't got no fuckin' time,1
To party on the weekend,1
I've been flippin' in the house,1
Makin' juggs on the highway,1
I've been ridin' out of state,1
Makin' money like my way,1
I don't think that I should dance,1
I'm just gon' have another drink,1
I'm doin' my stance,1
You know my molly pink,1
I got the loudest of the loud,1
You know my gas stink,1
My P.O. think I'm in the house,1
Don't give a damn 'bout what she think,1
[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen],0
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday,1
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey,1
Club goin' up on a Tuesday,1
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey,1
Club goin' up on a Tuesday,1
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey,1
Club goin' up on a Tuesday,1
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey,1
[Bridge: ILoveMakonnen],0
"It ain't no way, no how",1
I made it on my own,1
I made my own style,1
I don't think that I should stay,1
You know I gotta go,1
Been moving too fast,1
Don't wanna take it slow,1
[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen],0
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday,1
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey,1
Club goin' up on a Tuesday,1
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey,1
Club goin' up on a Tuesday,1
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey,1
Club goin' up on a Tuesday,1
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey,1
Club goin' up on a Tuesday,1
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey,1
Club goin' up on a Tuesday,1
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey,1
Got the club goin' up,1
