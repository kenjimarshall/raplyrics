[Verse 4: Too $hort],0
Bitch niggas in the house tell me what's up,0
A nigga slapped you in the mouth and told you shut up,0
Somebody holler get 'em and now you just a victim,0
"Shorty tried to stick 'em, told the pit bull to sic 'em",0
I know he wanna run but he can't he assed out,0
Punched him in his chin and then he passed out,0
Woke up with his pockets turned inside-out,0
Always hit them weak motherfuckers right in they mouth,0
You better stay out the way and act like you ain't havin' shit,0
Cause niggas will run up in yo ass like you a nasty bitch,0
"You little bitch, that's what the callin' you",0
You'd be a damn fool to act like you ballin' dude,0
"Mindin' yo business, they grabbed you by yo collar",0
You feel like Marvin Gaye cause they make you wanna holler,0
"But since you can't run, you might as well fight",0
Quit actin' like a bitch and live a real life,0
"You just a ""Bia' Bia'!""",0
