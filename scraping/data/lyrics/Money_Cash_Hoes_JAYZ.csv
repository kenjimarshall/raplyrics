Only wife of mines is a life of crime,0
"And since, life's a bitch in mini-skirts and big chests",0
How can I not flirt with death?,0
"That's life's enigma, long as life's within us",1
We gon' sin a lot and pray that Christ forgive us,1
Fuck it!,1
Ice the wrist and raise the price on these niggas,1
Y'all can't floss on my level,0
I'll invite you all to get with us if your ball is glitter,0
When I go all the Harlem playas wall my picture,1
"If you get close enough, you can read the scripture",0

"Roc-A-Fella forever, CEO, what! (what?)",0
Us the villains? Fuck your feelings,0
While y'all playa hate we in the upper millions,0
What's the dealings? (huh),0
It's like New York's been soft,1
Ever since Snoop came through and crushed the buildings,1
"I'm trying to restore the feelings; fuck the law, keep dealing",0
"More money, more cash, more chilling",0
I know they gon' criticize the hook on this song,1
Like I give a fuck...I'm just a crook on this song,0
Bed-Stuy Brook-Nam,1

[Verse 3: DMX],1
D-M-X and my dogs bite,1
"Jigga, my nigga, rhyme all night",1
"Thugs for life,",1
one night with this rap shit,0
Let 'em go and I bet they know what'll happen,0
When we clap shit,0
Acting like we owe 'em something,0
Then we show 'em something,0
"Talking greasy, I think they found 'em down the road or something (Wooh) Fucking with a mad man in a bad mood",0
Is like fucking with a,0
mad dog,1
that wasn't fed food,0
And the only thing that's stopping him is you (WHAT!),0
So the only thing that he'll be dropping is you (WHAT!),0
Chopping in two (COME ON!),0
"Then he drop it to Clue, and the response from the street:",0
This is one dog that loves raw meat (woo!),0
"But getting back to, just 'cause I, love my niggas",0
"I shed blood, for my niggas",0
"Let a nigga holla, ""where my niggas?""",0
"All I'ma hear is ""right here my nigga!""",0

[Outro: Jay-Z],0
Roc-A-Fella shit,0
"Uh huh uh huh, Ruff Ryders",0
Pa-pause,0
My nigga Swizz,0
"Uh huh, uh huh",0
"Don't stop, beatch",0
"Uh, uh huh, yeah",0
Respect the game yo,0
[Interlude: Pain In Da Ass],1
"Okay okay okay, so now the guy's working for Jay-Z",1
Making hot songs,1
"But any type of trouble he gets in, he runs to Jay-Z",1
"Trouble with the label, he calls Jay-Z",1
But he still has to come up with Jay-Z's money every week no matter what,1
"Not selling any records, fuck you pay me",1
"Oh you want me in your video, fuck you pay me",1
"No one's coming to your shows huh, fuck you pay me",1
And then what do you do when you can't borrow another dollar from the label?,1
You can't sell any singles in the stores?,1
You light a match....you blow the joint *explosion*,1
