[Verse 1],0
Toe to toe dancing very close,1
Body breathing almost comatose,1
Wall to wall people hypnotized,0
And they're stepping lightly,0
Hang each night in rapture,0
Back to back sacroiliac,1
Spineless movement and a wild attack,0
Face to face sightless solitude,0
And it's finger popping,0
24 hour shopping in rapture,0
[Verse 2],0
Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly,1
"DJ spinning I said ""My My""",0
Flash is fast Flash is cool,1
Fran√ßois c'est pas flashe [?] aux deux,1
"And you don't stop, sure shot",0
Go out to the parking lot,0
And you get in your car and drive real far,0
And you drive all night and then you see a light,1
And it comes right down and it lands on the ground,1
And out comes the man from Mars,1
And you try to run but he's got a gun,1
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head,1
And then you're in the man from Mars,1
You go out at night eating cars,0
"You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too",0
Mercurys and Subaru,1
"And you don't stop, you keep on eating cars",0
Then when there's no more cars you go out at night,0
And eat up bars where the people meet,0
"Face to face, dance cheek to cheek",0
"One to one, man to man",0
"And toe to toe, don't move too slow",0
Cause the man from Mars is through with cars,0
"He's eating bars, yeah wall to wall",0
"Door to door, hall to hall",0
He's gonna eat 'em all,0
"Rapture, be pure, take a tour",0
"Through the sewer, don't strain your brain",0
Paint a train,1
", you'll be singing in the rain",0
Said don't stop to the punk rock,0
[Verse 3],0
Well now you see what you wanna be,0
Just have your party on TV,1
Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars,0
Where the TV's on and now he's gone,0
Back up to space where he won't have a hassle,0
With the human race and you hip hop,0
"And you don't stop, just blast off",0
Sure shot cause the man from Mars stopped eating cars,0
"And eating bars and now he only eats guitars, get up",0
