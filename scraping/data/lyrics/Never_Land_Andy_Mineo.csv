[Intro: Marz],0
Looking in the distance,0
I'm dreaming of a world for us,0
When the moons align we'll map out a journey for you and I,0
For you and I,0
[Chorus: Marz],0
In the night I'm alone,1
"Without You, I'm drifting on",1
When You take my hand,0
I'm so high up I'll never land,0
"Up, up, up, up, up",0
I'll never land,0
"Up, up, up, up, up",0
I'll never land,0
"Up, up, up, up, up",0
I'll never land,0
"Up, up, up, up, up",0
And I'll never land,0
[Verse 1: Andy Mineo],0
Everybody wanna be on top,1
I don't think they know what that means,1
Once you get there then you can't stop,1
"Everybody gunnin' for ya' spot, aimin' at ya' team",1
"I'm up all night, chasin' dreams",1
Everything change when you go from seein' it all on,1
Big screen to behind the scenes,1
"Leadin' us on like this the life they lead, huh",0
Do you know the rich and famous kill themselves to stay rich and famous?,1
Very same thing that they built they name with,1
Be the same thing that they be enslaved with,1
"So, I don't want rap, you can have that",1
"I don't want the crown, yo', I'm aimin' past that",1
Headed for another throne can't have that,1
It's a Kingdom where my Dad's at,1
"And I'm His son, I sing on, so death won't have that last laugh",1
"(Huh) Child of a King, royalty, that's ASCAP",1
"They want glory, money, and power before you go",0
"I promise you it's empty, we aimin' just way too low",0
I know we own things we don't need to impress people we don't know,1
Then we go broke trying to look rich,1
"I can't do it, I just won't",1
My new goal is to be close to the one that made my soul man,0
Them other highs gon' let you down,0
I'm tryna get so high I'll never land,1
[Chorus: Marz],0
In the night I'm alone,1
"Without You, I'm drifting on",1
When You take my hand,0
I'm so high up I'll never land,0
"Up, up, up, up, up",0
I'll never land,0
"Up, up, up, up, up",0
I'll never land,0
"Up, up, up, up, up",0
I'll never land,0
"Up, up, up, up, up",0
And I'll never land,0
[Verse 2: Andy Mineo],0
I am Rufio with the ripped jeans (Uh),1
Kool Moe with the 16's,1
"In a studio, Michelangelo with a microphone writin' Sistines",1
But these songs ain't for the chapel,0
"Try to build with others, your own attack you",1
Try to be a light and they blowin' the match you lit,1
Can't use a shotgun to catch a fish,1
"I'm on, usin' a different tactic",1
Call me a boom-baptist,0
"Look at this rap cat with glasses, cookin' the track",0
And every time I look at my past,0
"I laugh like, ""Heh, you know where I should've been at?"", huh",0
Nowadays I just wanna make a classic,0
Tryna to set the bar way above the average,0
Then smash that for the glory of God,0
"And do rappers like Apple, leave 'em without jobs",1
Sittin' on the writer's block,0
Pennin' everything that's happening in and out,0
Ever since the album dropped,0
"Things changed, get the feelin' they won't stop",0
"I don't want to grow up, Neverland got no clocks",1
"But, let me give 'em bars and no shots",1
To catch em',1
I got a message about a blessin',1
But it's written in cursive,1
"You gonna face death, I know the one to reverse it, listen",1
[Bridge: Andy Mineo],0
When I say I get so high,1
"I ain't even talking 'bout sticky, no lie",1
The way up is down,1
Stay low to the ground and You close to the clouds,1
"Listen, when I say I get so high",1
"I ain't even talking 'bout sticky, no lie",1
The way up is down,1
Stay low to the ground and You close to the clouds,1
For real though,1
