[Verse 1: Big Boi],0
Time and time again see I be thinking about that future,1
Back in the days when we was slaves I bet we was some cool ass niggas,1
"But now we vultures, slam my nigga back out",1
"To make his ass black out, or even pull your fucking heater",1
"To make his whole crew believers, you're harder than a bitch full of dicks",1
But that don't be sounding like King Shit to me,1
See now in the ghetto or should I be saying Lakewood,0
You better be strapped cause them niggas over there just ain't good,0
"Just being a hustler, serving the loyal customers",1
Rent was due on the first of the month so I'm hustling,1
I buy you 50 box of Phillies at the Citgo,1
"And niggas be wanting drinks and shit from the fucking sto', yo",0
"But that's aight though, cause I be getting paid",0
"And every trip I take, there's a dollar to be made",0
I'm digging through my pockets for my earnings got you five,0
"Deep, there it is, now it's time to smoke that dime",0
[Chorus: Big Boi],0
"If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime",1
"If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime",1
[Verse 2: André 3000],0
"Time is slipping, slowly but surely",0
Niggas I used to hang with wants to act like they don't know me,0
"Come and listen to my story, I gots a lot of shit up on my mind",1
I wipe the boo-boo from my brain then I finish up my rhyme,1
"Take a number, I caught you in a slumber",1
"I hit you for a lick, I'm in the slammer for the summer",1
"But now it is the fall, I'm having a ball, making my nickel sacks crawl",0
To my niggas got to serving when they beep and when they call,0
"I got the Peter, Paul and plus that Mary Jane",1
"I'm rolling reefer out of a Regal,",0
how could I refrain,1
"From being rough, from being tough, from being dangerous",1
"I'm hanging with the P.A., nigga, ain't no changing us",1
"See you can try, if you try, if you don't, you don't",1
"If you wanna battle, it's either that you will or you won't",1
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke,1
"If you got some fire shit, yo niggas gonna always toke",1
"Dope, is not what I be slanging on this track",1
Niggas don't comprehend that it be deeper than Cadillacs,0
"You know that, right, you bite, you fucked up",0
"You won't be getting away this time, I'm real as hell, so what's up",0
"I rip shit wit pimp shit, I'm slanging it from the South",0
"Talk bad about the A-town, I'll bust you in your fucking mouth",0
[Chorus: André 3000],0
"If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime",1
"If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime",1
