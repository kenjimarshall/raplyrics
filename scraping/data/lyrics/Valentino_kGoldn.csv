[Chorus x2],0
I don’t want a valentine,1
I just want,0
Valentino,1
I just want the neck,1
I poker face like a casino,0
Deep throat,1
Know I get it in like a free throw,0
Shawty want some more,0
She just can’t seem to keep her knees closed,0
[Verse],0
I fuck her long,1
Ain’t no Minute Maid,1
My diamonds lemonade,1
"Flexing hard, call me Popeye",0
Wallet filled with spinach ayy,1
Cut you off on the interstate,0
"I’m first to finish, ayy",0
I’m a young rich nigga,1
Bitch it’s always been that way,1
To the grave,1
",",0
might just be tomorrow,1
Might just be today,1
So i always live it up,1
We poppin bottles,1
Poppin kays,1
Gucci shades from my boujee bitch,0
Ain’t even had to pay,0
Had to put on for the team,0
And,0
had to put on for the bay,1
I'm so fly when I rock robins wings,0
I can’t stay in one place,0
Russian cremes in my rocket ship,1
We go to outer space,1
"Mask off, mask on, fuck it",1
I can’t catch a case,1
"Blast off, blast off",1
See the stars up in wraith,1
You can't get into the crib,0
Because the mansion got a gate,0
You can't come into my section,1
I’m gon' put you in your place,0
If the club goin' up,0
You bet I’m sliding like a chase,0
And i think I fell in love,0
She shook that ass up in my face,0
[Chorus x2 ],0
I don’t want a valentine,0
I just want,0
Valentino,1
I just want the neck,0
I poker face like a casino,0
Deep throat,0
Know I get it in like a free throw,0
Shawty want some more,0
She just can’t seem to keep her knees closed,0
(She just can't seem to keep her knees closed),0
[Chorus x2],0
I don’t want a valentine,1
I just want,0
Valentino,1

I poker face like a casino,0
Deep throat,0
Know I get it in like a free throw,0
Shawty want some more,0
She just can’t seem to keep her knees closed,0
