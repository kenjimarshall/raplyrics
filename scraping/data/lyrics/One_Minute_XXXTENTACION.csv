"So much hate at the top, it's a lonely place",1
When you find out the opps ain't the only snakes,1
And your spouse only know what you don't erase,0
The world only know you by your worst mistakes,1
"So spaz on they ass, that's the only way",1
"Smash on the gas down Stony, ayy",1
Crash and come back with a swollen face,1
"And when I'm on my way, X hold the gate",1
"Terrorize shit, we don't negotiate",0
"If you bitch-made, we don't associate",0
Show up at your birthday if you owe me cake,0
"With a black mask, that's how we exfoliate",1
"So pardon my way, my heart's in the way",0
"I follow my thoughts, ain't no logic in Ye",1
"Said that's all I'ma say, if he caught him a case",1
"Then send him to jail, like a dog in a cage",1
"I ain't feeling the age, no rottin' away",0
"You're dark as the days, you caught in the way",0
'Cause coffins is laid under a tombstone,1
"'Cause even when you die, they still throwin' rocks at your graves",1
"So follow the wave, can't swallow the hate",0
My mind trumps anything that a scholar could say,0
"Don't know how to behave, we rage out of the raves",0
"Dislocate an arm, just pop it in place",0
"'Cause the damned, they ain't it, all the pain and anguish",1
"Turned me into a man, so I ain't complainin'",1
"Now these things is changin', no more lames is hanging",0
"No more fame in famous, ain't no shame in shamin'",0
"She wanna give you the cookie, you Famous Amos",1
"She gave you the pussy, but you ain't pay for the anus",1
"Now your name is tainted, by the claims they paintin'",1
"The defendant is guilty, no one blames the plaintiff",1
"Gotta say it in Layman's terms, while you wait on arraignments",1
"'Cause if the jury say you did it, the payment is heinous",0
"Give me one minute, my lady just fainted",0
"My babies is crying, you understand what I'm sayin'?",0
[Chorus: XXXTENTACION],0
"One minute, one minute, gone",1
"One minute, and the next one's mine",1
"One minute, one minute, gone",1
"One minute, and the next one's mine",1
"One minute, one minute, gone",1
"One minute, and the next one's mine",1
"One minute, one minute, gone",1
One minute and the next one's... mine!,1
[Bridge: XXXTENTACION],0
Ahaha,1
"Faith, I want more",1
"Faith, I want more",1
"Faith, I want more",1
"Faith, I want more",1
"Faith, I want more",1
"Faith, I want more!",1
[Chorus: XXXTENTACION],0
"One minute, one minute, gone",1
"One minute, and the next one's mine",1
"One minute, one minute, gone",1
"One minute, and the next one's mine",1
"One minute, one minute, gone",1
"One minute, and then the next one's mine",1
"One minute, one minute, gone",1
One minute and the next one'sâ€”,1
