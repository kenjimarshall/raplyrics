[Intro],0
Wake up Mr. West - Mr. West - Mr. West...,1
"Uh, yea, uh, yea, uh, yea",0
[Verse 1: Kanye West],0
"And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today",1
"From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way",1
So this is in the name of love like Robert say,1
Before you ask me to go get a job today,1
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?,1
And I know that the government administer AIDS,1
So I guess we just pray like the minister say,1
AllƒÅhu Akbar and,1
throw in some hot cars,1
Things we see on the screen that's not ours,1
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far,1
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars,1
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars,1
I guess they want us all behind bars - I know it,1
[Hook: Kanye West & Adam Levine],1
"Uh, and I heard 'em say (Ooh), nothing's ever promised tomorrow today",1
And I heard 'em say,1
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today (Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today),1
But we'll a find a way,1
And nothing last forever but be honest babe,1
It hurts but it may be the only way,1
[Verse 2: Kanye West],0
They say people in your life are seasons,1
And anything that happen is for a reason,1
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing,1
And Gran keep praying,0
and keep believing,1
"In Jesus, and one day that you see him",1
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him,1
The devil is alive I feel him breathin,1
"Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin",1
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us,1
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down,1
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now,1
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now,1
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?,1
"I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now",1
[Hook: Kanye West & Adam Levine],1
"Uh, and I heard 'em say (Ooh), nothing's ever promised tomorrow today",1
And I heard 'em say,1
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today (Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today),1
But we'll a find a way,1
And nothing last forever but be honest babe,1
It hurts but it may be the only way,1
[Post-Hook: Adam Levine],1
With every worthless word we get more far away,1
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today,1
And nothing last forever but be honest babe,0
It hurts but it may be the only way,1
"Oohh, Oohh, Oohh, Oohh",0
[Outro: Kanye West],1
"Uh, yea, uh, yea, uh, yea",0
