[Chorus: Roger Troutman],1
California love,0
California knows how to party,0
California knows how to party,0
In the city of L.A,0
In the city of good ol' Watts,1
"In the city, the city of Compton",1
"We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'",0
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre],1
Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West,1
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness,1
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest,0
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex,1
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be,1
The state where you never find a dance floor empty,0
And pimps be on a mission for them greens,0
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends,0
I been in the game for 10 years makin' rap tunes,1
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon,1
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me,1
"Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace",1
"It's all good, from Diego to the Bay",0
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay,0
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way,0
Dre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a,1
[Chorus: Roger Troutman],0
California knows how to party,0
"California knows how to party (Yes, they do)",0
In the city of L.A,0
In the city of good ol' Watts,0
"In the city, the city of Compton",0
"We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'",0
[Bridge: Roger Troutman],1
"Shake, shake it, baby",1
"Shake, shake it, mama",1
"Shake it, Cali",1
"Shake it, shake it, baby",1
"Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it",1
[Verse 2: 2Pac & Dr. Dre],1
"Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'",1
"Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'",0
"Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player",0
Where cowards die and the strong ball,0
"Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die",1
"In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (yeah, that's right)",1
"Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do",1
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews,0
Famous because we program,0
"Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans",1
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam,0
"It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man",1
"Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre",1
Let me serenade the streets of L.A,0
"From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down",1
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!,0
[Chorus: Roger Troutman],0
California knows how to party,0
"California knows how to party (Yes, they do)",0
In the city of L.A,0
In the city of good ol' Watts,0
"In the city, the city of Compton",0
"We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'",0

"Shake it, Cali",0
"Uh, uh, West Coast",0
"Uh, yeah, uh, uh, Long Beach in the house",0
"Uh, yeah, Oaktown",1
Oakland definitely in the house,1
"Frisco, Frisco",1

Dr. Dre,0

And you know L.A. up in here,0
"Pasadena, where you at?
Yeah, Inglewood
Inglewood always up to no good",0
"Even Hollywood tryin' to get a piece, baby",1
"Sacramento, Sacramento where you at?",0
"Throw it up, y'all! Throw it up, throw it up!",0
I can't see ya,0
Let's show these fools how we do it over on this Westside,0
'Cause you and I know it's the best side,0
"Yeah, that's right",0
"West Coast, West Coast",0
