[Intro],0
And I’m willing to borrow your grass,0
But I specialize in eating MC's,0
In the immortal words of LL Cool J,0
"As he would say: ""I'm a G.O.A.T.!""",0
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is,0
It means the Greatest Of All Time,0
And I consider myself one of those,0
"So thank you very much, here it goes",0
[Verse 1],0
This is the part I was worried about,1
Everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes,1
And I'm in some dusty garage,1
Inhalin' them carbon monoxide fumes,1
And everyone's tellin' me what I should do,0
And how I should come out and what to rap about,0
And I know I got a lot up,1
In my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out,1
And I'm not sure how this is gonna come off,1
They're probably gonna think that I'm comin' off as cocky,1
Like I just started givin' a fuck what you really think about me,0
"See, the thing about me",0
Is you don't really know a thing about me,0
Everyone's makin' a stink about me,0
Like there's some kind of an aura of that of the king around me,1
Surround me with nothin' but gangsters,0
Killers and bangers and the most dangerous criminals,0
And I feel like I'm more comfortable around them,0
Than I do my own motherfuckin' neighbors,0
"But see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave",1
But why does it seem like I'm not even put up in the same category as other MC's?,1
So when Weezy says that he's better than Jay Z,1
Please be that just subliminally,1
Means he thinks Jigga's the best,1
"And that he's the only one up in that league, see",1
And it's easy just to consider me,1
One of the greatest white rappers there is,1
"Knowin' goddamn well that I'm one of the best motherfuckin' rappers who ever lived, period",1
[Hook],0
I'm a G.O.A.T. and I don't mean to gloat,0
But I know what I know and I know what you think,0
And these magazines'll never put it in ink,0
Because how would it look if they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?,0
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is,0
It means the Greatest Of All Time,0
And I consider myself one of those,0
"So thank you very much, here it goes",0
[Verse 2],0
Maybe they figure that I'm on my way out the game,1
So they gotta go try to find 'em a new Eminem or a new Shady,1
"If they think it's gonna happen,",0
"man, I thought I was crazy",1
Or maybe I could be takin' it wrong,0
And they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way,0
So let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way,0
"See, you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringin' up that Paul Wall's white",1
"‘Cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone, see, he's just aight",1
"And Bubba Sparxxx, he just won't write",1
Because he's so caught up in that snow white,1
That Timbaland can't even get him in the studio,1
"He's so gone off that coke, right?",1
"And it's so sad ‘cause he's dope, right?",1
"America's next great white hope, right?",1
"So now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny-ass White Rapper Show, right?",1
And which I'm still havin' mixed feelings about,0
"They said it'd be real, I'm just spillin' it out",1
There's somethin' about a white boy talkin' black,1
And runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth,1
And I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit,1
"""Isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white",1
"And the best golfer's black?""",1
And I'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack off of that,1
But these are the people who never had heard of an Eminem until,0
8 Mile,0
had came out,0
But I had already hit middle America,1
Parents had all got to likin' me now,0
When suddenly I wasn't such a bad guy,0
All of the hatred for me must've died,0
Thought I committed career suicide,0
So I had to turn back into the bad guy,1
So faggoty faggoty faggoty gays,1
Anatomy God made Raggedy Ann and Andy,1
Not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy,1
And Angelina Jolie is just another ho,0
"And Brad is a sucka, because once I fuck her",0
She wants to go to Somalia to,0
adopt another baby,1
"You know what I say? — ""No.""",0
You better save some of them kids from Madonna,1
She needs all the publicity she can get,1
"You wanted Shady, well you got it, man, I ain't apologizin' for shit",0
[Hook],0
I'm a G.O.A.T. and I don't mean to gloat,0
But I know what I know and I know what you think,0
And these magazines'll never put it in ink,0
Because how would it look,0
If they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?,0
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is,0
It means the Greatest Of All Time,0
And I consider myself one of those,0
"So thank you very much, here it goes",0
[Outro],0
"Man, I'm takin' my ball and goin' home",1
"Man, shit is too easy",0
Nobody even wants to pass me the ball,0
‘Cause I'm a G.O.A.T.,0
"So don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game",1
And y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best,1
But y'all know that,1
I'm a G.O.A.T.,0
"And like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best",0
Before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch,0
"But before I go, I'd like to say fuck you very much",0
To everybody who wasn't there from the start,0
And thank you very much to everybody who was,0
"And y'all ain't gotta say it, just think it",1
‘Cause I know that you know that I know,1
That you know that I know that I'm a G.O.A.T.,1
"I'm out y'all, it's been real—peace!",1
