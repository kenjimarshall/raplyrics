"[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]",0
I never would've thought that,1
Feelings could get thrown in the air,1
'Cause I accidentally caught that,1
I need some new boxing gloves,1
Shit got hectic whenever I fought back,1
"For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts",0
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty four times,0
I think about you or something like that,0
"Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else",1
I don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong,1
'Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back,1
"This isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo",0
"And find time to write facts, fuck",0
I love you,0
"Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow",1
"Yeah, that's good",1
"[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]",0
"I fucking hate you, but I love you",0
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled,0
You're good at being perfect,0
"We're good at being troubled, yeah",0
I fucking hate you,0
But I love you,0
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled,0
You're good at being perfect,0
"We're good at being troubled, yeah",0
"[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]",0
"Girl, you fucking with my emotions",1
The fuck is all this noise about?,1
I even considered picking up smoking,1
"You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?",0
But in my dog house,1
My bitch is the raddest,1
Crazy who makes me the happiest can make me the saddest,1
"Look Alice, let's get lost in your wonder-er-land, fuck an atlas",1
You're perfectly perfect for me,1
"What the fuck is this, practice?",1
"Actually, if you even consider leaving",0
"I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathing",0
And you'll see the meaning of stalking,0
When I pop out the dark to find you,0
And that new dude that you're seeing with an attitude,0
Then proceed to fuck up your evening,0
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans,0
'Cause when I hear your name I can not stop cheesing,1
I love you so much that my heart stops beating when you're leaving,0
And I'm grieving and my heart starts bleeding,0
Life without you has no goddamn meaning,0
Sorryâ€”I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason,1
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons,1
"I'll fall for you, but I love you",1
"[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]",0
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled,0
You're good at being perfect,0
We're good at being troubled,0
Yeah,0
"[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator & Pharrell Williams]",0
"The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it",1
"The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it",1
"The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it tonight",1
"The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it",1
"The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it",1
"The sky's falling bitch, let's try to catch it tonight",1
"[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams & (Tyler, The Creator)]",1
"C'mon baby, even though I hate you, I still love you",0
I love you,0
"And Salem, my love (I know)",0
"I'm passive aggressive (I'm sorry, fuck)",1
(Come here),1
I like when we hold hands,1
(You're the best around),0
See I get jealous (Fuck),0
And if I see that nigga (If I see him),0
I just might kill him (Look),0
"(Look, I wanna strangle you, 'til you stop breathing)",0
"Love, love, love",0
"(Spend the rest of my life, looking for air)",1
"(so you can breathe, or we can die together, you and me)",1
"(Fuck, look)",0
I'm in love (Love),1
"[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]",0
I fucking hate you,0
But I love you,0
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled,0
You're good at being perfect,0
"We're good at being troubled, yeah",0
I fucking hate you,0
But I love you,0
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled,0
You're good at being perfect,0
"We're good at being troubled, yeah",0
