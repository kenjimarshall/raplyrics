[Chorus],0
"We got the jazz, we got the jazz",1
"We got the jazz, we got the jazz",1
"We got the jazz, we got the jazz",1
"We got the jazz, we got the jazz",1
[Verse 1: Q-Tip],0
Stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue,1
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21,1
"Just like Ringling Brothers, I'll daze and astound",1
"Captivate the mass, cause the prose was profound",1
"Do it for the strong, we do it for the meek",0
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep,0
Or your,0
Honda,1
", or your Bimmer, or your Legend, or your Benz",0
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends,0
"So push it, along, trails, we blaze",1
"Don't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise",1
The tranquility will make you unball your fist,1
For we put Hip Hop on a brand new twist,1
A brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic,0
So low-key that you probably missed it,0
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd,0
"When the guy takes the beat, they bowed",1
"So raise up squire, adjust your attire",1
We have no time to wallow in the mire,1
"If you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead",0
Join in the essence of the cool-out breed,0
Then cool out to the music cause it makes you feel serene,1
With the birds and the bees and all those groovy things,0
Like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work,0
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk,0
I don't really mind if it's over your head,1
Cause the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead,1
"So pay attention, it's not hard to decipher",1
"And after the horns, you can check out the Phifer",1
[Chorus],0
"We got the jazz, we got the jazz",1
"We got the jazz, we got the jazz",1
"We got the jazz, we got the jazz",1
"We got the jazz, we got the jazz",1
[Verse 2: Phife Dawg],0
Competition dem try fe come side way,1
But competition they must come straight way,1
Competition dem try fe come side way,1
But competition they must come straight way,1
"How's about that, it seems like it's my turn again",1
All through the years my mic has been my best friend,0
"I know some brothers wonder, can Phife really kick it?",1
"Some even wanna dis me, but why sweat it?",1
I'm all into my music cos it's how I make papes,1
"Try to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes",1
Me sweat another? I do my own thing,0
"Strictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing",1
I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks,1
"Collect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks",1
"I sing, and chat, I do all of that",0
It's 1991 and I refuse to come wack,1
I take off my hat to other crews that tend to rock,0
"But the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop",0
"I got Tip and Shah, so whom shall I fear",1
"Stop look and listen, but please don't stare",0
"So jet to the store, and buy the LP",1
"On Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's",1
Produced and arranged by the four-man crew,1
"And oh shit, Skeff Anselm, he gets props too",1
Make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers,0
"So the new shit can rock, from Bronx to Massapequa",1
Cause where I come from quality is job one,0
And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done,1
"So peace to that crew, and peace to this crew",0
"Bring on the tour, we'll see you at a theatre nearest you",0
[Verse 3: Q-Tip],0
"Hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up",0
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut,1
Back and forth just like a Cameo song,1
If you dig this joint then please come dance along,0
To the music cause it's done just for the rhyme,0
"Now I gotta scat and get mine, underline",0
"The jazz, the what? The jazz can move that ass",0
Cause the Tribe originates that feeling of pizazz,0
"It's the universal sound, bless the brothers on the ground",0
"And the ones six below, you didn't have to go",1
Some say that I'm eccentric cause I once had an orgy,1
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies,1
"If this is a stinker, then call me a skunk, I ask",0
"(""What's, wrong?"") Now check it out",1
[Outro: Q-Tip],1
All my peoples in Queens ya don't stop,1
Now all my peoples in Brooklyn ya don't stop,1
And all my peoples uptown ya don't stop,0
That includes the Bronx and Harlem ya don't stop,0
Now to that girl Ramelle ya don't stop,0
I said because Ladies First ya don't stop,1
"And to the JB's, ya don't stop",1
"And De La Soul, ya don't stop",1
To my Brand Nubians ya don't stop,1
And to my Leaders of the New ya don't stop,1
To my man Large Professor ya don't stop,1
Pete Rock for the beat ya don't stop,1
Everybody in the place ya don't stop,0
"You keep it on, to the rhythm, ya don't stop",0
And last but not least on the sure shot,1
It's the Zulu nation,1
