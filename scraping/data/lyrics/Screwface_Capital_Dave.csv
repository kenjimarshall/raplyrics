[Intro],0
"And I want you now with me
And I want you now with me
And I-",0
[Verse],0
I made a link with the Russians,0
"Six figure discussions, dinners in public",0
My linen all tailored,0
My outstanding payments swift like Taylor,1
And boy I owe 'dem men a beatin',0
But don't watch what I'm makin',0
Just know I put both of the P's in opp,1
"At the same time, I put the ""pay"" in paigon",1
"Man wanna beef, don't know what the stakes is",1
"Broad daylight, do a nigga want a day shift?",0
Three scales got 'em livin' on basic,0
My location changes quicker than gears on a brand new Porsche Cayman,0
I told RJ put down the line and he did,1
But he's got another three like H's,1
I gotta watch for the greed and the hatred,0
I'm sayin' who's on votes?,0
We hit up a nigga and see who's on smoke when it's that time,0
You can run that shit there and it's cool but you can't hear like a bad line,0
"It's been fifteen minutes since me and her fucked and I'm sayin' ""What you still in the house for?""",1
"Girls say I'm rude but they won't never leave, 'cause you know the jab right like southpaws",1
"Outdoors, me and my niggas are all outlaws",0
I tell a man speak with respect,0
How you gonna say that we beef with your chest,0
Like Sergei didn't G-lean on your set?,0
I do not have one neek as a friend,0
If it's beef on the ends than it's bleaker for them,0
This ting's comin' like Pokemon GO,0
"'Cause I see man once, never seen him again",0
Man don't really wanna walk to the shop,0
Or jump in the train 'cause the ends got tension,0
"One eye on my opps, two eyes on my friends",0
"'Cause at least my opps, man knows their intentions",0
I turned a loss to a lesson,0
I turned a curse to a gift and blessing,0
Any girl that I've got an interest in,0
"Face interesting, body impressive",0
I got ninety-nine out of a hundred marks in class on my English questions,1
I'd get the same if I did it again 'cause I still don't know the definition of restin',1
"I've put blood in, I've put sweat in",0
I shed tears when my niggas got sentenced,0
I spent years with my niggas in Streatham,0
But you wouldn't know that 'cause you don't live this,0
What have you done for your siblings?,0
I made sure that the family's sweet,0
So many days that I starved myself just to make sure that my whole family eats,0
The Merc is a beast and I'm blackin' it out,0
One point nine on the plan for a house,0
I ain't got a memory of when dad was around,1
Still a child when I turned man of the house,1
Tell me what you know about a bag full of bills,1
"And your mom crying out, saying, ""Son, I can't take it""",1
And then staring in the mirror for an hour,1
"With a tear in your eye like, ""I gotta go make it""",1
Ever seen a good friend turn paigon?,0
"A pretty girl glow down, turn basic?",0
Ever seen a nigga 'nough man rated,0
Losing his mind 'cause of food that he's takin'?,0
You're either a lamb or you're Hannibal,0
Good kid but I grew up 'round animals,0
No chick can't tell me about attitude,0
I got girl from the Screwface Capital,0
[Outro],0
"And I want
And I, and I
And I, and I, and I, and I
And I want, and I want
And I want
And I, and I
And I, and I, and I, and I
And I want, and I want
And I want
And I, and I
And I, and I, and I, and I
And I want, and I want
And I want
And I, and I
And I, and I, and I, and I
And I want, and I want",0
