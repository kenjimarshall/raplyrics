Couldn't last a day inside my head,1
That's why I did the drugs I did,1
Got issues with these motherfuckers,0
Looking down from they pedestals,0
"From that petty view, on that petty shit",0
Pray for peace with a knife in my hand,0
Speak my piece like a gun to my head,0
Come equipped just to blast this shit,0
Misunderstood since birth,0
"Fuck what you think, and fuck what you heard",0
"I feel betrayed, you can keep the praise",0
And all of the fuck shit need to get away,0
Still ain't got the fright to the fickle-minded people,0
"I thought I knew better, wish I knew better",0
"Should have known better, wish that I was better",0
At dealing with the fame and you fake motherfuckers,0
Guess I'm too real,0

Break the dam when I spit the flow,0
I'm on the lamb like the fuckin' wool,0
"Hoppin' out the van, I'm at Abbey Road",1
"Fans with cameras in the bathroom, man that's difficult",0
