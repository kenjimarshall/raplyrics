How come you're staring like you don't know what it's for?,0

[Pre-Verse: Ritchie With a T],0
We got these niggas looking at me,0
Like they've never seen a nigga put a real ass fucking 'fit together,0
They're so used to looking at these new goddamn Instagra...,0
Y'all niggas seen these Instagram pages?,0
"Where they literally tell you the whole entire outfit and the price range from head to toe, nigga",0
"So today, Ian Connor doesn't happen to have anything on top of his head",1
But he does happen to have the Supreme Playboy collab jacket on,0
And we're just gonna go ahead and skip to the bottom,1
'Cause can you guys notice that he does have the Rape 3000's on,1
And those are gonna cost you 'bout 450 dollars deadstock,1
[Verse 1: Ritchie With a T],0
"Yo, the new dressing off the mannequin shit",0
"You a cool guy in all black, on some Anakin shit",1
I be breaking necks and I ain't even plannin' these fits,0
"When I walk in, I got everyone panicking shit, like",0
"Like, why would you wear those to a function?",0
You know they gon' get stepped on,0
You know you gon' be punching niggas,0
(But I got two pairs),1
"Anything that can will, Murphy Lee's law, stunting",1
[Verse 2: Rico Nasty],0
"""You know that you're a black girl, right?",1
"Your hair's 'sposed to be sewed in, not spiked up?""",1
"I do what I want, not whatever gets the likes up",1
They don't like my outfit but they like the outcome,0
"You never seen these shoes, well, that's the reason I bought them",0
"They copy my swag, you can see that I taught them",0
"Fresh to death, I belong in a coffin",0
"But I'm way too liked to die, so often express myself",0
Put it in a song so I don't kill myself,0
Listen to it back and then I heal myself,0
I got money and the power and I'm still myself,0
"Mama said, ""Don't go broke tryna feel yourself""",0
"Mama said, ""Don't break tryna build yourself""",0
And don't feel ashamed if you need some help,0
"'Cause we all do, 'cause we all lose",0
[Verse 3: Stepa J. Groggs],0
'Cause we all know someone who blown their whole rent on some Off-White,1
I ain't got none but I'm still trippin' off white,1
Lost my mama and I lost my mind and I still ain't got my head right,1
"Yeah, out in London I was dropping pounds",0
While my pockets fat off synching sounds,0
Had me dressed like the cover from Seeing Sounds,1
"Got all these clones frontin' tryna be me now, like",1
