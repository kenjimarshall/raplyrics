"Fresh out the club, on my way back to the mansion",0
"You know where I’m from, you don’t ever gotta ask us",0
"Banged out, still, these hoes think I'm handsome",0
"And yes I run my city, run my city single handed",0
If they’d made a movie about my life it would be a classic,0
Drove a bucket and we used to share a mattress,0
Looking at me now you can see the contrast,0
When I’m chilling with a model from Toronto in the Hamptons,0
"So what do you need, cause you can have it",0
Long as you willing to bleed for what you’re asking,0
And when you see it you seize it with a passion,0
Cause we don’t believe in second chances,0
The way you fill up them jeans make me imagine,0
"But I don’t live in a dream, I make it happen",0
Don’t mean to get in between you and your standards,0
"But since every night is a scene, I’m yellin’ action",0
"I’ve got the meat and the cheese, let’s make a sandwich",0
Just grab which ever of your home girls is the baddest,0
Hopefully she got a swag that could match this,0
"But she could be whatever she want, except average",0
And dressed in something I can mess with,0
Spend a lil’ something on you bag is expected,0
Louis Vuitton and Valentino collections,0
All you Ugg-boot bitches I don’t mess with,0
"I’m international, them niggas are domestic",0
Fuckin' with a baller and usually bringin' out the best in,0
And when it’s over you can count me as your blessing,0
Cause every single loss in your life is a lesson,0
"I’m on, and I know I am",0
And I ain’t in nobody rush cause I know my plan,0
"Money first, women second, and you hoes is last",0
Cause I don’t wanna fuck if I know I can,0
"And yeah, you got a butt, but your soul is whack",0
You like a coke bottle but the soda’s flat,0
Your style like the plastic on the sofa set,0
And run and tell your homegirls I told ya that,0
"Look, damn, flow kinda tough",0
And I don’t hate y’all I just only love us,0
The title that I hold is what every one wants,0
But still I play the game like I never one once,0
"It's eleven, you know, one one",0
And every generation had to do what I’ve done,0
To the people I’m a hero unsung,0
"Good thing I don’t want fame, I want funds",0
But if they say my name the bell rung,0
"I’ve been through so much pain, I feel numb",0
"The Marathon, my nigga, I’m on one",0
For as long as the Lord pump air through these lungs,0
"And I ain’t perfect, Lord knows I murked shit",0
Until the day that he gave me something to work with,0
"Open my eyes, he show me it wasn’t worth it",0
"Told me if I lowered my pride, I’d find purpose",0
And it was hard to see the set was a serpent,0
"Going too fast to turn, inertia",1
Gotta apply the lesson that you learn,1
"You should come fuck with a star, get off earth dick",0
"Got money, but you still feel worthless",0
"Fuck like a porn star, pussy like a virgin",0
"And in return, he keep you in fly purses",0
But when he gone you calling my line urgent,0
"Cry me a river, I’ve never be the buyer of them lies you deliver",0
The real is me is mesmerized into women,0
Most of the times she never been with this fly of a nigga,0
"And I am the realization, of the dream of this motherfucking nation!",0
"Come on, for pussy and power you be patient",0
"Come up first, that’s the order of operations",0
Broke nigga hope you hear what I’m saying,0
Either that or you should pop Scarface in,0
Learn the rules to the game that ya playing,0
You got a cell waiting on you in the state pen,0
Hope you hear what I’m saying,0
Either that or you should pop Scarface in,0
Learn the rules to the game that ya playing,0
Cause they got a cell waiting on you in the state pen,0
"Yeah, uh, TMC",0
