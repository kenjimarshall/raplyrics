[Verse 1],1
"Yeah, uh, yeah",1
Livin' life like this,1
Gotta paint a picture when I write like this,1
"Tales from my hood, not a sight like this",1
Where they up to no good on a night like this,1
And they murder motherfuckers just 'cause,1
"Type of shit I see, you probably wonder where I was",1
"I was in the crib, just sittin' on the rug",1
Basedheads comin' through lookin' for the plug,1
"Now, born and raised in my area",1
"Beautiful by day, by night it's hysteria",1
Fuck around and bury ya tonight,1
Ridin' with my homies on sight,1
Momma tell me to come in at night,1
"Now I really gotta go, but they never know",1
"Livin' life to the fullest, I gotta blow",1
"Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib",1
In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib,1
"Goddamn, what it feel like, middle of the night",1
"Wakin' up, scared for my life",1
"Never had the heat, just a knife",1
When the gat go blat like that,1
Guarantee you it’s a wrap,1
Finna put you on your back like that,1
"Just breathe, while their mama grieve",1
Bullet to the dome like an Aleve,1
"Gotta leave for the premises, to murder my nemesis",1
"No, no, uh, uh, just stop, stop, stop",1
‘Fore they even call the cops,1
Do it for the money and the bitches,1
And the drugs and the props,1
Tell me why another body even gotta drop,1
Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related,1
[Break: News Report Sample],1
"Up first at five tonight, breaking news in Gaithersburg, where a massive manhunt is underway after a deadly shooting. It's all unfolding in the 400 block of West Deer Park and 355. Our Montgomery County reporter joins us, with the latest tonight",1
[Verse 2],1
Livin' life like this,1
Hope little Bobby never fight like this,1
Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this,1
All about the money on a night like this,1
"Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib",1
"Got a lot to give, but I never had the chance",1
"Never had the chance, yeah",1
"Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out",1
If you want it I'ma lay it out,1
Hope my little brother make it out,1
Every night what I pray about what I pray about,1
"Check it, uh yeah, got a son on the way",1
But I cling to the streets even though I wanna run away,1
I imagine a better life,0
Where I never had a debt in life,0
Hit you with the *gunshots*,1
in the dead of night,1
Sellin' crack to my own pops,1
Pushin' this weight on my own block,1
If I sell a brick I can buy a house,1
If they find the key they might lock me up,1
But I take the chance 'cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck,1
"Take the chance, 'cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck",1
[Pause],0
—,0
Get down or lay down,1
"Hit ya with the Beretta, you better stay down",1
Stray shots on the playground,1
Livin' how I'm livin' with the life that I'm given,1
"Anybody that’s ridin' with me, I’m ridin' with 'em",1
"Show me the enemy, and I'ma hit 'em",1
"The second I bit 'em, I get 'em",1
And hit 'em with the venom,1
Ain’t no need to pretend I'ma never do it,1
"I knew it, already been through it",1
"I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life",1
Anybody that's gang related,1
