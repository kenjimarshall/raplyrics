line,annotated
[Refrain],0
Here to save the day and steal the game,0
It ain't a crime if you don't get caught,1
I know names who're moving the same,0
"We're staying out the way, we get away with a lot",0
[Verse 1],0
My quiet thoughts at night can turn rowdy,0
Light bulbs and bright ideas can turn cloudy,0
Big dreams even if they doubt them,0
I never wasn't sure if I wasn't sure about them,1
"This is not your thing, this is ours",1
Gangsters got this thing about flowers,1
Rappers got this thing about power,1
"Bitter and sour, gossip at the top of every hour",1
Walking in the rain off the Jim Beam,1
"Dreams broken on the boulevard, Jim Dean",1
Get a grip for bars like a gym beam,1
Eyes redder than the rastas on the swim team,1

[Verse 2],0
I ain't thinking about BET,0
"I'm talking about debt, 'D' to add the 'E-B-T'",1
"91, Dub C, don’t work, you don’t eat",0
Crossed streets where reality and hard times meet,0
Back in my youth I was a wildcat,0
Put my tires in reverse and get some miles back,1
It's been a minute since a while back,0
"Round of applause, blow the horns like Miles back",0
"It's God's work, that is not in my hands",0
But I'm holding on tight for a few of my fans,0
It's dedicated if the line is short,0
"And if the line goes long, that was your support",0
There was a few times I wanted your respect,1
But you tried to play me like some kind of a threat,1
"The time done been elusive, ain't a lack of love",1
"Just an alley cat, got a lack of trust",1
I went from slow flow to never the same flow,1
Cause doing part two's not the reason I came for,1
Until then I at the end of the rainbow,0
But still the pot of gold about as real as the game shows,0

[Verse 3],0
"Trooper, just below forty with the wind chill",0
All my shorties getting spin like the windmills,0
"Weatherman, I’ve been hailed the sky curse",0
Fire verses I write for what the prize worth,0
"Pot love, won, then I got stuck",0
"Fell, then I got up",0
"Never went back down, never played the background",0
"Anxious more than patient, I attack now",0
Don't get my way is when I act out,0
Never waiting on the industry,0
Waiting on the tables 'til the tables turning into me,0
"Go back, hands on the clock, you call it throwback",0
But only no dope and judge not if I know that,0
"Need is need, that ain't weak shit",0
"But greed is greed, that's some weak shit",0
I make a promise I'ma keep it (one-two),0
Never take my kindness for a weakness,1

"He's very concerned with how much rainfall, and of course, snowfall is going to be seen from many locations extending from California and beyond",0
