Young Hov' in the place to be,0
Big Boi in the place to be (Young!),0
"André 3000 (Cash!) Shout out to public housing, bitch",0
I brought (Holla!) the whole hood with me,1
You got red dirt in your afro,1
Young Hov' in the place to be (Yeah),0
OutKast in the place to be (Yeah),0
[Verse 1: Big Boi],0
Did you ever think that you would be the nigga on the block?,0
"Didn't have to break a steerin column, didn't have to cook a rock",0
"A damn goodie two-shoes, that what they call ya",0
Never judge a person or a book by it's covers,0
"Just because my tone is darker than yours, a little tanner",0
"You never took the time out, examine yourself boi",0
".. are you black, white, Asian?",0
"Indonesian, or Borean; that's black and Korean",0
We on the same team if we breathin,0
I jumped off the subject to see if you was seein,0
That we drop a little science off in every verse,0
They put that P.A. sticker on it cause they scared we gon' curse,1
"But the knowledge is the power, the cowards get devoured",0
"Any hour, any cipher, any way to any height",0
Because I might just snap on a fuck-ass nigga,0
Might clap a cap at a sucka-ass nigga,0
"In the meantime, Daddy Fat Sax gon' chill out",1
"He might just, pull out his pistol",0
And let that thang whistle at your windshield or your residence,0
"Superman to Clark Kent, you better be way harder",0
Than the park bench to start this,0
"Marcus, Jason, my little brother James",1
All my brothers from my momma but Andre is just the same,1
"Ain't no uno, we a duo; deuce dos to a pair",1
A player stiffen the competition,1
"Pressed like Levi's and tough skins,",1
one minus one,1
Negative one minus negative one is nothin,1
Bustin d-boy raps and player poems,1
"The 'Kast shit ain't plastic, we smash it and move the crowd",0
And rock the crowd original material while you bore 'em,0
Your live show consists of everybody's shit but you're-uns,0
Do your own shit! In your live show (Bitin'-ass nigga),0
[Chorus: JAY-Z],0
Young Hov' in the place to be,0
Big Boi in the place to be (Young!),0
"André 3000 (Cash) shout out to public housing, bitch!",0
"I brought (Holla!) the whole hood with me (Yeah, yeah)",0
Young Hov' in the place to be,0
Big Boi in the place to be (Young!),0
"André 3000 (Cash) shout out to public housing, bitch!",0

[Verse 2: Big Boi],0
Penelope Ann Cruz couldn't snooze,1
With her Eyes Wide Shut,1
", before I asked to hit her gut",0
"If you brunette, Legally Blonde I might respond",0
Take you to Swan Lake and beyond,1
"Antwan raps on, raps on, clap off clap on",0
I switch the flow so quick you cannot fa-thom,0
I take a submarine two thousand leagues below the sea,0
And try to grab one line or sentence,0
"Rhyme repentance, find the illest lyricist",0
And give him a clean bill of health,0
Wealth might make you look good but you sound like shit,0
And your team lookin shitty to death,0
[Verse 3: Killer Mike],0
"My nigga Big Boi said, watch 'em as they gawk and they gander",0
You can follow or lead like Commander Picard,0
"You can have ""The Whole World""",1
"Or be satisfied with the boulevard, overstand",1
This young player's rhyme,0
I foregoed the crime and I focused on rhyme,0
"Focused on every word, and line",0
Like a young Cassius Clay in his prime,0
"I was born to talk shit and prove mine, and I'm",0
The epitome of raw rhyme,0
"Got signed, got serious about the craft",0
Of raw rhyme and I got mine—Aqueminis,0
Murderous monster move minds,0
Did it so hard that it oughta be a crime,0
"When you see I'm comin holla one-time, holla one-time",0
When you see I'm comin holla one-time (One-time),0
[Chorus: JAY-Z],0

[Interlude],0
"Don't, you, like, to groove",0
"In your hooptie on your old, flip, flop, sweatshoes",0
To run yo' tennis shoes,0
"Don't, it, matter to you",0
That OutKast we got that slump for y'all,0
Keep that funk for y'all,0
[Verse 4: JAY-Z],0
When I'm in the mood I rock the S Dot tennis shoes,0
"At the interlude, I got the Gucci flip-flops",0
"And I, fix it up like gin and juice when I'm in them interviews",1
Dudes wanna know what he copped,1
"And where you got that, and how could they buy that",1
"Where the million dollar watch at, stop that!",1
"Why that, why this, niggas wanna hijack the flyness",1
I'm on a whole 'nother plane,1
"A whole different lane, a whole 'nother game that I'm playin'",1
Understand what I'm sayin',1
"Hov' and OutKast, whatchu think about that?",0
Really don't matter though what you niggas chatter though,0
Anybody get out of line then you trust,0
"That the MAC'll go b-r-r-r-r-ap, got you killed for that alone",0
"Back on the shit, back on the strip",0
"Another hit, I'm not gon' miss",0
[Interlude],0
"Don't, you, like, to groove",0
"In your hooptie on your old, flip, flop, sweatshoes",0
To run yo' tennis shoes,0
"Don't, it, matter to you",0
That OutKast we got that skunk for y'all,0
Keep that pump for y'all,0
