[Intro],0
I shot the sheriff,1
"(""Don't get too close because you might get shot"")",1
I shot the sheriff,1
[Verse 1: Erick Sermon],0
Try to answer to the master or the MC rap God is no joke,1
On the lyric - it's hard to be modest,0
I knew I was the man with the master plan,1
"To make you wiggle and jiggle, like gelatin",1
"Just think while I sink, into the brain structure",0
"(Don't sleep on the E) You see, somethin' might rupture",0
It don't take time for me to blow your mind,0
Take a second to wreck it because you're dumb and blind,0
So just lounge.. cause you're a MC clown,0
Go join the circus.. EPMD's in town,0
[Parrish Smith],0
Total chaos -- no mass confusion,0
Rhymes so hypnotizin' known to cause an illusion,0
"Like a magician.. who pulls a rabbit out a hat, son",0
I pull them all like a .44 Magnum,0
"MC freeze stop look and listen, and try to imagine",0
"It's travellin' the speed of light, but everything's motion",0
Is frightening.. plus the thought you alone,0
"You now enter dimension, called the Twilight Zone",1
You're terrified.. plus you can't bear the thought,0
"You and I one-on-one,",0
in the Land of the Lost,1
"You start to shiver.. but then you scream, my friend",0
"Yo, wake up Muttley, because you're dreamin' again",1
"But next time I'm on the scene, do not try to diss us",0
"Keep your mouth shut sucker duck, because I'm Strictly Business",0
[Hook],0
I shot the sheriff,1
[Erick Sermon],0
This is the rap season.. where the E starts pleasin',0
Girls around the world no need to be skeezin',0
"When I roll I stroll, cool always pack a tool",0
Just in case.. a brother acts a fool,0
"I've got the energy, to put the girls in the frenzy",0
"Put it in shock when I rock, give it up I'm not stingy",0
Make sure I don't bore when I'm on the dance floor..,0
"(Get busy, boy) Like you never saw before",0
"Rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. I'll pull your ho, boy",0
"Rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. I'll pull your ho, boy",0
"Rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. I'll pull your ho, boy",0
"Rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. I'll pull your ho, boy",0
"(Yo, you sniff blow?) .. Hell no!",0
"I got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffin'",0
"And my parents find out, then they start riffin'",0
"So I stay, a-okay, cause I'm the E.. the R-I-C-K",0
[Parrish Smith],0
"MC's look me in my face, then their eyes get weak",0
Pulse rate descends.. heart rate increases,0
"It's like beam me up, Scotty, I control your body",1
I'm as deadly as AIDS when it's time to rock a party,0
"And all due respect, when I say mic check",0
Let a sucker slide once -- then I break his neck,0
"So when I say jump, you reply, ""How high?""",0
"Because I'm takin' no prisoners, so don't play hero and die",0
You're just a soldier.. and I'm a Green Beret,0
I do not think twice about the MC's I slay,0
"So if you want to battle, I highly recommend this:",0
"Bring your dog, mom, and dad.. because I'm Strictly Business",0
[Hook],0
I shot the sheriff,1
[Erick Sermon],0
"Yo yo, you're still pickin' on that four-leaf clover?",0
"Bring in the Sandman, sucker.. because it's over",0
My name is Erick Sermon and I'm back again,0
I see the heads still turnin' and my so-called friends,0
They smile in my face -- behind my back they talk trash,0
Mad and stuff -- because they don't have cash,0
Like the E-Double.. or the PMD,1
"He drives a Corvette, I drive a Samurai Suzuki",1
I'm a locksmith.. with the key to fame,0
Never high on myself -- always stay the same,0
"Play a lot because I'm hot, like a horse I trot",0
"Around the track and back -- fatigued? No, I'm not",0
[Parrish Smith],0
"Well I'm the mellow, the fellow, the one who likes to say hello",0
To a fly girl that is good to go,0
"With the slow tempo, and the off-beat rhyme flow",0
"Cause when I am in action, there is no time for maxin'",0
Or relaxin' -- just reactin' and subtractin',0
On a sucker MC who mouth keeps on yappin' and flappin',0
"I lose my cool, then I'll start slappin' and smackin'",0
You wanna roll? Then Albee start jackin' and cappin',0
"No time to lounge, I'm packin' and strappin'",0
At my point of attack I soar at you like an eagle,0
"I'm the sheriff, and bitin' is illegal",0
"So next time in town, I highly recommend this",0
"You gots to chill, because I'm Strictly Business",1
