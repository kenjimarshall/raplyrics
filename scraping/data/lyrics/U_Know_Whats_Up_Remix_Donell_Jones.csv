[Verse 1: Donell Jones],0
Me and my niggas be rollin',0
Scheming on you and your homies,0
The very first day of summer,0
All chromed out in a Hummer babe,0
Hit the park and parlay,0
Hope that you walk this way,0
Do you and your girls wanna ride,0
"Play all day, puff on the la",0

So tell me what's up,0
[Verse 2: Donell Jones],0
Peep her thighs and I'm zoning,1
Right around two in the morning,0
Looking fly with the sun dress on,0
I think I feel a bone coming on,0
Girl you got me wide open,0
Waitin' all day and I'm hoping,0
So baby don't front,0
"Backseat Jeep, you know what I want",0

"Uh, say what? say what? say what?",0
So baby tell me what's up,0
Can we ascend to higher heights,0
And when the path gets rough,0
We can give into brighter nights breathe with peace,0
"Expound by leaps, and soul to reap, our souls to keep",1
"The passion's deep, and filled with heat",0
"Living this life on the hustle, I barely get enough time",0
"You know me from the platinum, how I stack them and shine",1
"You see a lot of contenders, they try to end up in my world",1
A reputation known as the untouchable girl,0
"I'm moving on now, trying to make a change in my ways",1
Be the best that I can be to last me all of my days,0
Now we can blaze pathways or just take our time,0
Better holla if ya hear me cause Left Eye gon' shine,0
"My eyes don't lie, see how they glisten when you pass me by",0
You and I don't need permission to be unified,0
Surely I done seen and heard of many places,0
"Then I travelled around the world, seen many faces",0
Don't let another one get near me if you wanna be true,0
And show me that nobody else can do it better than you,0
"So if you're serious, I'm curious to see what you got",0
But love is furious cause I believe in blowing up spots,0
[Hook: Donell Jones],0
I'm digging you and I'm feeling you,0
And you know what's up,0
Said I'm diggin' you and I'm wanting you,0
So tell me what's up,0
[Outro: Left Eye],0
"Untouchable, Eddie F",1
"Darren Lighty, Left Eye, Donell Jones",1
This is how it's going down,0
