Guaranteed to get more cut than a barber,1
I betcha I'll drill your heifer like Black & Decker,1
The pussy wrecker and White Water couldn't get it wetter,1
I'm guaranteed to never swiss cheese for more cheddar,1
"I give a fuck, suede bucks and Coogi sweaters",1
What's up? Whatever sable fur to lamb leather,1

"Attempted murder dick, for ways I choke chicks",1
Spit it in her eye make it hard to focus,1
"Killer Mike gonna calm down, things gonna get a little crazy
Ol' girl might yell rape G, you might as well give her a throat baby",0

"Need her to gobble up jism, like school lunches",1
Need her to take cat beatings and throw punches,1
"Like a swarm of locusts, no hocus-pocus
You wanna approach us, buzzards and vultures
We two of the dopest mic controllers
Stack big bank, honey folders
Even wit' rollers, I'm trying to told ya
Even loving, lavish, ladies, leaving, landmarks
Of Lemon-lime, lip gloss on your lavender lapels
Leaping lizards, keep me slizzard, my mind's expanding
Readily rappin' and snappin', snappin' and trappin'
That's just what's happening",0
