And it's been my pleasure to get vetted in this getting precedence,0
"Invested and diversified, imagine my appall",0
When a bitch that wanna try me can't even buy shit at the mall,0
"When I'm the type to help a bitch, and I ain't competing with you broads",0

The type to make local strippers do too much for crumpled ones,0
You out here workin' your ass off for a bad boy you fuckin' love,0
You leavin' a good guy to go chasin' after a thug,0
"Not knowing his ass ain't even a G, he a fuckin' dub",0
