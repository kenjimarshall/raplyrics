"Yeah, doo-doo-doo",0
"Doo-doo-d-doo, diggy-doo, yo",0
[Hook],0
There are times,1
When you'll need someone,1
I will be by your side,1
There is a light that shines,1
Special for you and me,1
[Verse 1],0
"I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this",1
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this,0
"Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute",0
"Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it",0
"Signed, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together",1
"Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever",1
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you,1
"I ain't gon' assault them, â€˜cause I probably did it too",1
"Because of you, feelings I handle with care",0
Some niggas recognize the light,0
But they can't handle the glare,0
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts,0
If relationship is effort I will match your work,0
I want to be the one to make you happiest,1
And hurt you the most,1
"They say the end is near, it's important that we close",0
To the most high,0
"Regardless of what happen, on Him let's rely",0

[Verse 2],0
It's important we communicate,0
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch,0
I never call you my bitch or even my boo,1
There's so much in a name and so much more in you,1
Few understand the union of woman and man,0
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land,0
"But that's fly by night, for you in the sky I write",0
"For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light",1
"If Heaven had a height, you would be that tall",0
"Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all",0
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall,1
"For better or worse times, I hope to me you call",0
So I pray every day more than anything,0
Friends we'll stay as we begin to lay,0
"This foundation for a family,",0
love ain't simple,1
Why can't it be anything worth havin' you work at annually?,1
Granted we known each other for some time,1
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine,1

[Verse 3],0
It's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop,0
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop,0
Plus you shit pop when it's time to,0
"Thinkin' you fresh, suggestin' beats I should rhyme to",0
At times when I'm lost I try to find you,0
You know to give me space when it's time to,0
"My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness",0
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence,1
"The time we committed love, it was real good",1
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good,1
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you,0
"But as my equal, it's how I must treat you",0
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you,0
And whatever's right I'ma feed you,0
"Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da",0
"Yo, I tell you the rest when I see you; peace!",0
[Hook],0
There are times,1
When you'll need someone,1
I will be by your side,1
There is a light that shines,1
Special for you and me,1
[Outro],0
I'll take my chances,1
Before they pass,1
"Pass me by, oh, darling",1
You need to look at the other side,1
You'll agree,1
