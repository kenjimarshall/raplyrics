[Verse 2: Eminem],0
When me and Fif' got together to do this music,1
The more we became enveloped,1
We just developed a fellowship through it,1
"It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, mi nemesis es su nemesis",1
"Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images",1
"But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out",1
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out,1
"If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it",1
It usually just evolves into one big brawl,1
And we all get involved in it,1
"And we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit",1
"And wear it like a badge with honor, pass it around and share it",1
And let it go to whoever's holdin',1
The most current beef on their shoulders,1
And their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over,1
But tonight we ain't come in here to beef with nobody,1
"We came to party: Banks, Ca$his, and Mr. Ferrari",1
"So it's Shady, Aftermizath, back in that ass, you izzask?",1
"Come izzon, what kinda fizzuckin' quizzestion is that?",1

Forever I'ma be a Shady 7-4 gangsta,1
