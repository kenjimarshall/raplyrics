"I can feel the vibe, Hussle on the rise",0
"This lil' light of mine, I'm gon' let it shine",0
"All she want is time, all she want is time",0
"Look me in my eyes, call me on my lies",0
Lock the city down til' the summertime,0
Time to slice these niggas up some humble pie,1
"Caravan of foreigns, let my youngin drive",0
Elevate my game for the hundredth time,0
You could hold me down through these troubled times,0
Or be another victim to my stubborn pride,0
Hold me down through these troubled times,0
Be another victim to my stubborn pride,0
[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle],0
I'm stuck in the grind,0
"Stuck in the grind, I'm stuck in the grind",0
"Look me in my eyes, call me on my lies",0
"I'm stuck in this grind, I'm stuck in this grind",0
[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle],0
Middle of the night kitchen lights is on,0
Roll me up a Bacc then I light the stove,1
Taught her stay calm when the crisis on,0
"Say I die alone, I say my life a poem",0
Hyde Park Hussle speakin' hyperbole,0
"Translation, get the money never wife a hoe",0
Clip is full already now it's time to go,0
Shoulder full already where these stripes should go,0
Crash got opinions how my life should go,0
"I'm screaming, ""Fuck em',"" they could suck a dick and die tonight you know",0
"Bullets, rain on em', cut the life support",0
My section ride for sport every night of course,0
"Niggas dyin' every day, that's the price of war",0
Gang members spendin' thousands at the nicest stores,0
"Levitate on five-star luxury, every time I ride shit come for me",0
[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle],0
I'm stuck in the grind,0
"Stuck in the grind, I'm stuck in the grind",0
"Look me in my eyes, call me on my lies",0
"I'm stuck in this grind, I'm stuck in this grind",0
[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle],0
"Make a movie, take the top off",0
'Bout to cross over like Hot Sauce,0
"On this gutter shit, I never hopped off, most calculated move by far",0
Always with a model and a fly car,0
"Thirty-thousand for the python, rockin' knee-high, drinkin' white wine",0
Listening to In My Lifetime,1
in the night time,0
"Lookin' at the city skyline, gettin' sky high",0
"Took the lil' bitch to Popeye, she was top 5",0
Excitement that she get from pop life could never top mine,1
"Once you get the hustle locked down, you can stockpile",1
"Level up another notch now, like it's stock now",1
Every time I take the top down she arch her eyebrows,1
"Turnin' up the music high now, she feel alive now",1
"Love me like we from a small town,",1
let's make a mall round,0
"You splurge, I splurge",0
We ball later and we ball now,0
[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle],0
I'm stuck in the grind,0
"Stuck in the grind, I'm stuck in the grind",0
"Look me in my eyes, call me on my lies",0
"I'm stuck in this grind, I'm stuck in this grind",0
[Verse 4: Nipsey Hussle],0
Ain't no goin' back once them lights on you,1
"Left the dorm in the middle of the night, homie",0
"Affidavits goin' viral, that's your life, homie",0
"Ain't no point even tryna lie, homie",0
This go out to all the S.N.Y. homies,1
"This is death before dishonor, you should die. homie",0
"Fuck you niggas, you disrespected the tribe, homie",0
"Wounded pride, it's written all in your eyes, homie",0
[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle],0
I'm stuck in the grind,0
"Stuck in the grind, I'm stuck in the grind",0
"Look me in my eyes, call me on my lies",0
"I'm stuck in this grind, I'm stuck in this grind",0
