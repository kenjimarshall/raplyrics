Have you heard the news today?,1
They say a little 14-year old little girl had a baby on the way,1
Too much for her little mind to bear,1
And that type of news to her Mama she cannot spare,1
[Hook: André 3000],0
"Toilet Tisha, damn we miss you",1
Toilet Tisha is the issue,1
"Damn we miss you, Toilet Tisha",1
Damn we miss you,1

"Tisha? Tisha! Tisha, girl what you doing?",1
"Oh my god, oh, Tisha, Tisha!",1
"Ah, no! Tisha! Tisha!",1
"Ah, no! Not my baby!",1
"Ah, no! I love you, no!",1
"Ah, good Lord, ah!",1

"Five thousand, one hundred ten days is a short period of time",1
A mere fourteen years on this precious mother earth,1
You see Tisha had issues,1
And her decision making skills were still in its early stages,1
You know what I'm talking about,1
Therefore she could not properly handle a blessing in which,1
She thought to be an obstacle in her path to adulthood,1
"Pause, Just like a brother with a thousand pauses",0
"Should I, shouldn't I, I can't, I have to, Mama will never see me the same",1
Daddy and Big Mama I know all of them gonna be ashamed of me,1
Are just a few thoughts racing through her cranium,1
"As she sits on top of the pale, cold porcelain seat in the rear of the house",1
"The unthinkable moments away from becoming reality, sadly with no clue",1
And no way of expressing her feeling to her mama or anybody else in her life,1
Tisha done came to the crossroads and now she got to choose,1
"Fatality, fatality, fatality, fatality",1
