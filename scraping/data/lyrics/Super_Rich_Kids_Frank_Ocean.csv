[Chorus: Frank Ocean],1
Too many bottles of this wine we can’t pronounce,1
"Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms",1
The maids come around too much,1
Parents ain’t around enough,1
Too many joy rides in daddy’s Jaguar,1
Too many white lies and white lines,1
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends,1
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends,1
[Verse 1: Frank Ocean],0
Start my day up on the roof,1
There’s nothing like this type of view,1
Point the clicker at the tube,1
I prefer expensive news,1
"New car, new girl",1
"New ice, new glass",1
"New watch, good times babe",1
"It's good times, yeah",1
She wash my back three times a day,1
This shower head feels so amazing,1
"We’ll both be high, the help don’t stare",1
"They just walk by, they must don’t care",1
"A million one, a million two",1
A hundred more will never do,1
[Chorus: Frank Ocean],1
Too many bottles of this wine we can’t pronounce,1
"Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms",1
The maids come around too much,1
Parents ain’t around enough,1
Too many joy rides in daddy’s Jaguar,1
Too many white lies and white lines,1
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends,1
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends,1

"Real love, I’m searching for a real love",1
"Oh, real love, I’m searching for a real love",1
"Oh, real love",1
[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt],1
Close your eyes to what you can't imagine,1
We are the Xanny-gnashing,1
"Caddy-smashing,",0
bratty ass,1
"He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag",1
And used that shit for batting practice,1
Adamant and he thrashing,1
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed,1
Panic and patch me up,1
Pappy done latch-keyed us,1
Toying with Raggy Anns and Mammy done had enough,1
"Brash as fuck, breaching all these aqueducts",1
Don’t believe us,1
"Treat us like we can't erupt, yup",1
[Alternate Verse 2: Frank Ocean],1
Polo sweats and Hermes blankets,1
Them label hoes be stealing my shit,0
And all they clothes revealing they tits,1
"Pills, high enough to touch the rim in that bitch",1
We party in my living room,1
'Cause father is gone,1
And he left me this empire,1
That runs on its own,1
So all I got to do is whatever the fuck I want,1
All we ever do is whatever the fuck we want,1
[Verse 3: Frank Ocean],0
We end our day up on the roof,1
"I say I’ll jump, I never do",1
But when I’m drunk I act a fool,1
"Talking bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits",1
"I’m on that ledge, she grabs my arm",1
She slaps my hand,1
"It's good times, yeah",1
"Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall",1
The market's down like 60 stories,1
And some don’t end the way they should,1
My silver spoon has fed me good,1
"A million one, a million cash",0
Close my eyes and feel the crash,1
[Chorus: Frank Ocean],1
Too many bottles of this wine we can’t pronounce,1
"Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms",1
The maids come around too much,1
Parents ain’t around enough,1
Too many joy rides in daddy’s Jaguar,1
Too many white lies and white lines,1
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends,1
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends,1
[Outro],0
"Real love, ain't that something rare",1
"I’m searching for a real love, talking bout real love",1
"Real love, yeah",1
Real love,1
I’m searching for a real love,1
Talking bout a real love,1
