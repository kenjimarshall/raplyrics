"Ladies and gentlemen, you coulda been anywhere in the world tonight, but you’re here with us in New York City.",1
Are you ready for a cabinet meeting???,1
"The issue on the table: Secretary Hamilton’s plan to assume state debt and establish a national bank. Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir",1
[JEFFERSON],0
"‘Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.’",1
We fought for these ideals; we shouldn’t settle for less,1
"These are wise words, enterprising men quote ‘em",1
"Don’t act surprised, you guys, cuz I wrote ‘em",1

[JEFFERSON/MADISON],1
Oww,1
[JEFFERSON],0
But Hamilton forgets,1
His plan would have the government assume state’s debts,1
"Now, place your bets as to who that benefits:",1
The very seat of government where Hamilton sits,1
[HAMILTON],0
Not true!,1
[JEFFERSON],0
"Ooh, if the shoe fits, wear it",1
If New York’s in debt—,1
Why should Virginia bear it?,1
"Uh! Our debts are paid, I’m afraid",1
Don’t tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade,1
"In Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground",1
We create. You just wanna move our money around,1
This financial plan is an outrageous demand,1
And it’s too many damn pages for any man to understand,1
Stand with me in the land of the free,1
And pray to God we never see Hamilton’s candidacy,1
"Look, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky",1
Imagine what gon’ happen when you try to tax our whisky,1

",",0
a financial diuretic,1
How do you not get it? If we’re aggressive and competitive,1
The union gets a boost. You’d rather give it a sedative?,1
A civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor,1
Your debts are paid cuz you don’t pay for labor,1
“We plant seeds in the South. We create.”,1
"Yeah, keep ranting",1
We know who’s really doing the planting,1
"And another thing,",1
Mr. Age of Enlightenment,1
"Don’t lecture me about the war, you didn’t fight in it",1
"You think I’m frightened of you, man?",1
We almost died in the trench,1
While you were off getting high with the French,1
"Thomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President",1
Reticent—there isn’t a plan he doesn’t jettison,1
"Madison, you’re mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine",1
"Damn, you’re in worse shape than the national debt is in",1
Sittin’ there useless as two shits,1

Where my shoe fits,1
