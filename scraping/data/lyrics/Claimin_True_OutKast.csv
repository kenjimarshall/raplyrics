[Verse 1: Big Boi],0
"Well it is I, the pimp player nigga that you heard about",1
"Yeah, I got the money and a half a million dope houses",1
I got the hookers on the go and playa rhymes that I fuck with,0
And bury amps that pops my trunk swift,1
I've been a player since the age of two,1
"That's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk",1
Do how them hustlers do,1
"See born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be",1
Always claiming true to what I do and then fuck what I see,0
"I pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up",1
And make my money 'cause my daddy never showed up,1
"But fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone",1
"And nothing wrong, you don't belong, you left me standing alone",1
"Yeah, I'm the nigga with the feather in my hat",0
"Finger waves and snake skins, shit, I got all that",0
But you ain't know I'm the one dipping and dodging bullets,0
The price you pay when you behind it steady trying to pull it,0
"So Dolemite, Dolemite not shit",1
I studied The Mack and Rudy Ray Moore,1
They were my idols when I was a kid,1
"From nappy head, greasy face, eating watermelon",0
"To drug dealer, armed robber, now convicted felon",0
[Chorus: Big Boi],0
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes,1
"I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues",1
"Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be",1
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me,1
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes,1
"I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues",1
"Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be",1
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me,1
[Verse 2: Andr√© 3000],0
"Our heavenly Father, why do you even bother watching over me?",1
"Growing up a little G, my mama thought I'd grow to be",1
A lawyer or a doctor but I felt like coming harder,1
Packed a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten,1
"This ain't no secret garden, so you flower niggas flee",1
"If it is one of my own, I'm letting the trigger be",1
'Cause I got love for any nigga who got love for me,1
And then I get a slap or dap from niggas slinging quarter keys,0
"Just trying to make it, then of age, come through, take it",0
I ain't forgot about y'all women who be working Nikki's butt naked,1
"At Magic City, shaking titties just to pay the rent",1
"Lord, trying to hustle must be something that was heaven sent",0
"But I ain't got no sense, that's what I got them thinking",0
"I think about Barack, strap myself and keep on danking",1
'Cause I be taking the rough side of the mountain,0
"If you cross my path, I'll leave you draining like a fountain",0
"Yes it's been like that since way back, in 1975",1
Been taught to hustle with muscle and even try to strive,0
So little batty bwoy better say your prayers,1
You better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya,1
[Chorus: Big Boi],0
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes,1
"I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues",1
"Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be",1
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me,1
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes,1
"I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues",1
"Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be",1
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me,1

So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me,0
"[Kawan ""K-Axe"" Prather]",0
"Yeah, it's K-Axe, here to let y'all know",0
"Ain't shit changed, just a couple of more names",0
"Yeah, that's right",0
"Organized Noize, JOI, Big Gipp, Big Rube",0
"CeeLo, Goodie Mob, P.A., and the muthafuckin' OutKast",0
"That's right, nigga, we taking that bullshit no mo' in '94",0
