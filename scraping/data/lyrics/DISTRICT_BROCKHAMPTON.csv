Let me find my way out of this bitch (Uh),1
Find myself high in the distance (Uh),1
"Find me up, lying in this ditch (Uh)",1
With a wrist and some diamonds a-mixin' (Woo),1
If I can't find the time to get my heart out (Uh),1
Would you stomp 'em out when we slow the world down? (Uh),1
Would you hold it down for me when my heart pound? (Uh),1
"Ain't no telling, no telling, so call the coroner",1
Let me find my way out of this bitch (Uh),1

"I'm alive, I'm alive, the bags in my ride, I, I",1
I ain't ever been the one that's scared of you,1
"Baby, you can come and get it",1
"I'm alive, I'm alive, the bags in my ride, I, I",1

Maybe you can run away with us,1
[Verse 4: Dom McLennon],0
"In my bag in the vault, moving on, move along",0
"Ain't my fault, moved too fast, life had skidded to a halt",0
Got back on the road and made it to the start,0
Disregard the emotional discharge,0
Can't forget the mission put into my heart,0
I ain't playing games with you to play your part,0
Standing up with pride behind my battle scars,0
[Verse 5: Matt Champion],0
"Money walk and money talk, but money no make comfortable",0
Big ass house and big ass car don't add up when you die alone,0
"I want wife, nice life highlights with some little clones",0
"I want bliss, no strife",0
"Rewind, don't slice around my aura with the better lies",0
"I want a better life, bend around the corner",0
"One deep, eyes shut when they know the place",0
"But you don't know me, I don't correlate",0
"Straight from manipulation, wouldn't wanna infiltrate my brothers",0
"Still wanna get me high, eyes low off that methadone",0
"Always throwing curve, like a reaper scythe",0
Gnawing on my wood like a termite,0
Entering my world like a parasite,0
"(Parasite, parasite, parasite, parasite)",0
