"You ready to turn your 'fro, from natural straight to a cold wave",1
"Dat ho name Betty Big Shoez, she wore them Herman Munster heels",1
"Popped a pill, now she's in your Coupe De Ville, passenger seat",1
I made her eat my meat while I was rubbin' her coochie,1
Injection in her top and bottom lip straight from her booty,1
"So Do Re, blow me, Fa So La Ti Da Ha I'm tellin' the truth",1
You suckin' your tooth you treatin' her like a star boy,1
From a Figueroa to a Herringbone,0
From droppin' her off to takin' her home,0
She tried to pull my rubber off with her pussy muscles that was wrong,1
The bitch is no good like lesbians with no tongues,1
You fucked around and knocked her up and now you say she the one,1
"Nigga you dumb, you should have pulled it out and squirted on her eyelash",1
"And let her face be holdin' the baby, now she after yo ass!",1
"Yeah, I told y'all niggas",1
About god damn takin' them hoez to the Cheesecake Factory,1
Lettin' them hoez order strawberry lemonade and popcorn shrimps,1

But try to take all your motherfuckin' cheese! (Yeah!),1
