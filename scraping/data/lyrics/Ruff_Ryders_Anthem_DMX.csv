"Niggas wanna try, niggas wanna lie",0
Then niggas wonder why niggas wanna die,0
"All I know is pain, all I feel is rain",0
How can I maintain with that shit on my brain?,0
"I resort to violence, my niggas move in silence",0
Like you don't know what our style is,0

"My niggas is with it, you want it come and get it",0
"Took it then we split it, you fuckin' right we did it",0
What the fuck you gon' do when we run up on you?,0
Fuckin' with the wrong crew,0
Don't know what we're goin' through,0
I'ma have to show niggas how easily we blow niggas,0
When you find out there's some mo' niggas,0
That's runnin' with yo niggas,0
"Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle",0
Light it up like a candle just 'cause I can't stand you,0
Put my shit on tapes like you bustin' grapes,0

"Nosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you",1

That's how niggas get down,0

"Come up off that green, rob niggas on ravine",0
Don't make it a murder scene,0
"Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone",1
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home,1
"Home of the brave, my home is a cage",1
Ayo I'ma slave till my home is a grave,1
"I'ma pull capers, it's all about the papers",0
Bitches caught the vapors and now they wanna rape us,1

"Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop",0
"Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll",1
"Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop",1

"Look what you done started, asked for it, you got it",0
"Had it, shoulda shot it, now you're dearly departed",0
"Get at me, dawg, did I rip shit?",0
With this one here I flip shit,0
Niggas know when I kick shit it's gon' be some slick shit,0
What was that look for when I walked in the door?,0
"Oh, you thought you was raw? BOOM! Not anymore",0
"'Cause now you on the floor, wishin' you never saw",0
Me walk through that door with that .44,0
"Now it's time for bed, two more to the head",0
"Got the floor red, yeah that nigga's dead",0
"Another unsolved mystery, it's goin' down in history",0
Niggas ain't never did shit to me,0
Bitch-ass niggas can't get to me,0
"Gots to make the move, got a point to prove",0
"Gotta make them groove, got 'em all like ""Ooh!""",0
So to the next time you hear this nigga rhyme,0
Try to keep your mind on gettin' pussy and crime,0
[Chorus],0
"Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop",1
[Outro],0
"Talk is cheap, motherfucker!",1
