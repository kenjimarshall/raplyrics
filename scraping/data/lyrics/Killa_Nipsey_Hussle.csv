[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle],0
"My AC on, my ceiling cracked, smoking killa",0
"Light my backwood, count 100 racks, smoking killa",0
"I pull up in that black on black, smoking killa",0
"My AC on, my ceiling cracked, smoking killa",0
[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle],0
"I wake up in this state of mind, like sky's the limit",0
"My niggas said you crossed the line, well I'm gon' kill you",0
"I'm focused on a million cash, that's the vision",0
"Speeding and I'm finna crash, that's the feeling",0
"Until my tires burn, though, and my wheels give out",0
"These backwoods burn slow, like my bills dish out",1
"When them people come for you, they gone steal yo house",0
"Put yo name on them papers, they gone fill you out",0
"Couple moves from yo quota, come fuck up yo count",0
Have you thinking bounce back when you out,0
"Look, I'm tip-toeing over traps",0
"Tight-roping at a height, you fall you knowing it's a wrap",0
"But I'm gon' keep this balance, cause it ain't no turning back",0
"Ain't no looking down, my niggas ain't concerned with that",0
More concerned with cash,0
"More concerned with running laps, running rap",0
"Getting rich, then run it back",0
[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle],0
"My AC on, my ceiling cracked, smoking killa",0
"Light my backwood, count 100 racks, smoking killa",0
"I pull up in that black on black, smoking killa",0
"My AC on, my ceiling cracked, smoking killa",0
[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle],0
"What's the deal, nigga? What's the deal, nigga?",0
"How you feel? Now you know this shit is real, nigga",0
"Once upon a time was in the field, nigga",0
"War time, really kill or kill, nigga",0
"Gunfire, shooting out civills, nigga",0
"Young, wild, police gon' deal with you",0
Not too many still living,0
So I gotta paint it real vivid,0
"I'm surprised that I'm here, nigga",0
"Naw, I'm blind to my fears, nigga",0
"I shine like De Beers, nigga",1
"And fly like a Lear, nigga",1
"Climb like the stairs, nigga",0
"Spend time out in Paris, nigga",0
Come from where the grannies gotta bury niggas,0
And money make these hoes wanna marry niggas,0
[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle],0
"My AC on, my ceiling cracked, smoking killa",0
"Light my backwood, count 100 racks, smoking killa",0
"I pull up in that black on black, smoking killa",0
"My AC on, my ceiling cracked, smoking killa",0
[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle],0
I think about them late nights,0
Drive to Vegas across the state lines,0
"Finally did it, it just take time",0
"Since I was ye' high, my only goal was get this cake right",0
"And what they say, right",0
"You on your own, it's what you make life",0
"You was out there everyday, right?",0
"Tryna push foreign, tryna eat steak, right?",0
"Put some hunnids in yo safe, right?",0
"Hang some flat screens in yo place, right?",0
"Life insurance, just in case, right?",0
"Gave something to the lawyer, just in case, right?",0
"Sitting solo, first class, on a straight flight",0
I remember waiting on my day like...,0
"Everyday I'm on this paper chase, like",0
Stand between these buildings 'til the daylight,0
Wiggle through the prisons and the grave sites,0
"Then you finally get it, and you take flight",0
[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle],0
"My AC on, my ceiling cracked, smoking killa",0
"Light my backwood, count 100 racks, smoking killa",0
"I pull up in that black on black, smoking killa",0
"My AC on, my ceiling cracked, smoking killa",0
