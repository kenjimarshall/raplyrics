Take a look at my girlfriend,1
She's the only one I got,1
Not much of a girlfriend,1
I never seem to get a lot,1
[Verse 1: Travie McCoy],0
It's been some time since we've last spoke,0
This is gonna sound like a bad joke,0
"But Momma, I fell in love again",0
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend,0
And I know it sounds so old,1
But Cupid got me in a chokehold,1
And I'm afraid I might give in,1
"Towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin'",1
"I mean, she even cooks me pancakes",1
And Alka-Seltzer when my tummy aches,1
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is,1
We even got a secret handshake,1
And she loves the music that my band makes,1
"I know I'm young, but if I had to choose her or the sun",1
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun,1

It's been a while since we talked last,1
And I'm tryin' hard not to talk fast,1
"But Dad, I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one",0
Type of girl that'll make you way proud of your son,0
And I know you heard the last song,1
About the girls that didn't last long,1
But I promise this is on a whole new plane,0
I can tell by the way she says my name,0
I love the way she calls my phone,1
She's even got her very own ringtone,1
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is,1
It's gonna be a long drive home,1
But I know as soon as I arrive home,1
"And I open the door, take off my coat, and throw my bag on the floor",1
She'll be back into my arms once more for sure like,1

She's got a smile that'll make the most senile,1
Annoying old man bite his tongue (I'm not done),1
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise,1
And it doesn't stop there (Man I swear),0
"She's got porcelain skin, of course she's a ten",1
Now she's even got her own song (But movin on),1
She's got the cutest laugh I've ever heard,1
And we can be on the phone for three hours (Not sayin' one word),1
And I would still cherish every moment,1
"And when I start to build my future, she's the main component",0
"Call it (dumb), call it (luck), call it (love)",1
"Or whatever you call it, but",1
Everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like,1
