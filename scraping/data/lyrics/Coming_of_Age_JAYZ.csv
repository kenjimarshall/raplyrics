[Intro: Jay-Z],0
Yeah...,0
Come experience... life as we know it,0
As some of you should know it,0
"Place: Marcy, Brooklyn",1
"Actions: well, y'all know the actions",0
[Verse 1:  Jay-Z],0
"Uhh, I got this shorty on my block always clocking my rocks",0
He likes the style and profile I think he wanna mock,0
"He likes the way I walk, he see my money talking",0
"To honies hawking, I'm the hottest nigga in New York and",0
"I see his hunger pains, I know his blood boils",0
"He wanna run with me, I know this kid'll be loyal",0
"I watched him make a few ends, to cop his little sneakers and gear",0
Then it's just enough for re-up again,0
"I see myself in his eyes,",0
I moved from Levi's,1
"To Guess to Versace, now it's diamonds like Liberace",1
"That's just the natural cycle,",0
nobody want to be like Michael,1
"Where I'm from, just them niggas who bounced from a gun",1
We out here trying to make hard white into cohhhhld green,1
I can help shorty blow out like Afro-Sheen,0
Plus I can relive my days of youth which is gone,0
"That little nigga's peeps, it's time to put him on",0
[Chorus: Jay-Z & (,0
Memphis Bleek,0
)],0
It's time to come up (,0
"and hold my own weight, defend my crown",0
),0
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (,0
stand my ground,0
),0
It's time to come up (,0
"stick up my chest, and make some loot",0
),0
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (,0
stand on my own two,0
),0
[Verse 2: Memphis Bleek],1
"I'm out here slinging, bringing the drama, trying to come up",0
In the game and add a couple of dollar signs to my name,0
"I'm out here serving, disturbing the peace",0
Life could be better like my man reclined in plush leather seats,0
"He's selling weight, I'm selling eight.. balls",0
"Sixteen, trying to graduate to pushing quarters y'all",0
I ain't going to sweat him I'm a let him come to me,0
If he give me the nod then these niggas going to see,0
"I'm tired of being out here round the clock, and breaking day",0
And chasing crack heads up the block for my pay,0
"I'm staying fresh, so chickens check",0
I'm trying to step up to the next level,0
"Pushing Vettes through the 'jects, diamonds reflect from the sun",0
"Directly in your equilibrium, and stunned",0
"I'm waiting for my day to come, I got the urge to splurge",0
I don't want a lifetime sentence,1
", just give me the word",0
[Chorus: Jay-Z & (,0

Hey fella I been watching you clocking,0
"Who me? Holding down this block it ain't nothing
You the man nigga, now stop fronting",0
Hahah I like your style,0
"Nah, I like your style",0
"Let's drive around awhile,",0

"Here's a thou',",0
A G? I ride with you for free,0
I want the long-term riches and bitches,0
"Have it all, now listen to me",0
"You let them other niggas get the name, skip the fame",0
Ten thou' or a hundred G keep your shit the same,0
On the low?,0
"Yeah, the only way to blow",0
"You let your shit bubble quietly,",0
AND THEN YOU BLOW!,0
Hey keep your cool,0
The only way to peep a fool is let him show his hand,0
"Then you play your cards, then he through dealing I understand",0
Don't blow your dough on hotties,0
"The only thing I got in this world is my word and my nuts
And won't break them for nobody",0
"Hah, I like your resume, pick a day, you can start",0
"From now until death do us part, nigga",0
