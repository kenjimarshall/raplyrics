A couple of months ago they gave OutKast the key to the city,1
But I still gotta pay my taxes and they give us no pity,1
About these youngsters amongst us,1

And giving the youth the truth from this booth,1
And when we on stage we scream,0
"Don't everybody, everybody",0

Not to Africa cause not one of them acknowledge us as their kin folk,1
Still eatin' pork,1

Penalty for violation is death,1
"Woe, woe, to the man that strive with his maker",1
