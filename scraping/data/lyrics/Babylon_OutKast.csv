[Verse 1: André 3000],1
I came into this world high as a bird,1
From second hand cocaine powder,1
I know it sounds absurd,1
I never tooted but it's in my veins,1
While the rest of the country bungies off bridges,1
Without no snap back,1
And bitches they say they need that,1
To shake they fannies in the ass clubs,1
They go the other route,1
Turn each other out,1
Burn each other out,1
Where a bona fide nigga like me,1
Can't even get no back rub these days,1
Ain't that bleak on they part,1
"But let me hold it down, 'cause they shut you down",1
When you speak from your heart,1
Now that's hard,1
While we ranting and raving 'bout gats,1
"Nigga, they made them gats",1
They got some shit that'll blow out our backs,1
From where they stay at,1
[Hook],1
"Ooooh, I fear the battle's just begun",1
"Ooooh, though we're here someday we will be gone",1
"So I'm hoping, wishing, praying",1
"To keep my faith in you, in you, in you",1
[Verse 2: André 3000],0
I'm fascinated by the way yo,1
Nipples peak at me through yo blouse,1
"Freaky me, freaky you",1
Can't help but be aroused,1
"'Scuse me, Lord lustful thinking",1
But that's the way we was brought up,1
Sneaking to watch Playboy at night,1
We all must be caught up in worldly ways,1
Chemistry between boys and girls,1
Is a lot like when we went to the woods,1
And laid with the squirrels,1
"During P.E., we'd be",1
Exploring each others privates,1
Hunching with all our clothes on,1
"Until we felt excited then, aaaah",1
"Oh, now it's on from here on out",1
Put yo hands in the atmosphere,1
If you know what I'm talking about,1
Now if too harsh then walk on out,1
And I'll see you on the next song,1
They call it horny,1
Because it's devilish,1
"Now see, we dead wrong",1

[Verse 3: Big Boi],0
People don't know the stress I'm dealing with day to day,1
Speaking about the feeling I'm possessing for Renee,1
Moping around and wondering where she stay,1
Saw her last that she lay,1
"Give it another day, I say",1
"But the Lord, he taketh away",1
"Now give it back, lawd",1
'Cause that's like backboards without the rims,1
Me and my auntie was tight like Southwest,1
Before the pinks moved in,1
Like the niggas who owned the liquor store,0
"Crack cocaine, pimps and whores",0
Living up on this earth,0
Before a nigga like daddy was born,0
But they be making it seem,1
That my music and crime are a team,1
But I'm speaking the truth not dreams,1
So what in the fuck they mean,1
My lyrics ain't clean,1
