"Nah, chill baby... I was just kidding though",0
"You know I got your back whenever you're on, kill 'em Jones!",0
"Oh, so you a ride or die chick?",0
On your side till death like a certified Crip,0
And they can never touch you unless they wanna die quick,0
"Nah, they never seen a beat getting murdered like this",0
"Aiyo, it's hell on earth",1
", who's next or gonna be first?",0
These rappers looking like a shawty with a cheap purse,0
"Okay, so basically they need work",0
'Cause I be kicking most of them,0
And I can tell that's why your feet hurt,0
"Nah, I'mma be okay mamacita",0

And just know this: if you believe,1
That mi ndio king and of course mi sirudilii,1
Na hawa ma-nigga walikuwa off sahii warudi leave,1
"Chill na siasa, hii si CORD ama Jubilee",0
"Okay, so you getting political now?",0
Somebody had to address these political clowns,1
"You see, them citizens is waiting for a miracle now",1
That's enough... so let's get lyrical now,0
"Check it, I'm a lyrical Picasso",1
", ka ni muziki mi nafanyia umati",0
"Wanafikiri ni vako, wapige tizi, hatupotezi wakati",0
"Utanipata niki-hustle,",0

"Throne is mine, hao ni dakika mbili- ile design ya Bahati",1

"Oh for real? I thought you was gon' pass the ball
But it's like you don't want me to rap at all",0
"Oh no, nah baby, I ain't mean that ish",0
"But on the real, I really doubt if you can spit that quick",0
"I'm sick now, I get down, I run this town",0
"Man I flow for six rounds, they love this sound",0
For a gig?,0
Nothing less than 90 mill- Chris Brown,1
"
And when the queen talk",0
", I suggest you sit down",0
This industry needs to be saved,1
I'm tired of seeing my people being treated this way,1
I mean why're we gassing up all these foreign acts;,1
"And when a Kenyan does it well, then they call it wack?",1
"
It's obvious that they decided to fall off track",0
But they said hip-hop is dead,1
-,0
but we brought it back,0
"Hold up, there's something I've been longing to say",0
To all the Kenyan DJ's saying they got nothing to play from the Kenyan market,0
Why you gotta speak that way?,0
If we support each other we gon' all eat that cake,0
