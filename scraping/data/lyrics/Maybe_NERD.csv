But you found that you were wrong,0
"See, maybe, there was something wrong, and you weren't telling me, no (Nooo)",0
"See, see, maybe, the laugh's on me, and life was telling me a joke",0
[Verse 2],0
"Well, they say that if it's yours",0
And you let it go,0
If it comes back to you,0
It was yours all along,0
"Well, I let you go, along with those lies from you",0
I wonder what else lies in you,0
Or did the lies just eat it gone,0
