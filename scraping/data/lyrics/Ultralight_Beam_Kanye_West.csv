[Verse 2: Kelly Price & Choir],1
So why send oppression not blessings?,1
"Why, oh, why'd you do me wrong? (More)",1
You persecute the weak,1
Because it makes you feel so strong (Safe),1
Don't have much strength to fight,1
So I look to the light (War),1
To make these wrongs turn right,1
"Head up high, I look to the light",1
"Hey, 'cause I know that you'll make everything alright",1
And I know that you'll take good care of your child,1
"Oh, no longer am afraid of the night",1
"'Cause I, I look to the light",1

No one can judge,1
"They don't, they don't know",1
They don't know,1
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea,1
I'm moving all my family  from Chatham to Zambia,1
Treat the demons just like Pam,1
"I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina",1

"I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail",1
"He said, ""Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'""",1
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy,1
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard,1
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet,1
"This is my part, nobody else speak",1
"This is my part, nobody else speak",1
This little light of mine,1
"Glory be to God, yeah",1
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go,1
If they don't wanna ride I'ma still give 'em raincoats,1
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow,1
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro,1
"Ugh, I'm just having fun with it",1
You know that a nigga was lost,1
I laugh in my head,1
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt,1
"Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike",1
You cannot mess with the light,1
Look at lil' Chano from 79th,1
