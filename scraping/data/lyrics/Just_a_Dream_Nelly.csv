I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement,0
"Number one spot, now she found her a replacement",0
I swear now I can't take it,1
Knowing somebody's got my baby,1
"And now you ain't around, baby I can't think",1
"I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring",0
'Cause I can still feel it in the air,0
"See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair",0
My love of my life,0
"My shorty, my wife",0
"She left me, I'm tight",0

When I be riding man I swear I see her face at every turn,0
Trying to get my Usher on but I can't let it Burn,1
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn - for,0
"My woman, oh I miss her, when will I learn?",0
"Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback",1
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby,0
"Hey, she was so easy to love",0
"But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough",0
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone,0
"And now I'm missing, wishing she pick up the phone",0
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on,0
'Cause I was wrong,0

If you ever loved somebody put your hands up,1
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up,1
And now they're gone,0
And you wishing you could give them everything,0

And you wishing you could give them everything,0
