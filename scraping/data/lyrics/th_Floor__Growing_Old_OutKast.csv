[Intro: Big Rube],1
Conceive true deception multiplied a million fold,1
Visualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense,1
That we get em confused,1
The resident evil specialize in misconstruing,1
We wanna be at a presidential level—what are we doing?,1
"Fooling ourselves, clowning ourselves, playing ourselves",1
By not being ourselves,1
We can't babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat,1
Nimrod by the time we forty cause we can't get off meat,1
While we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season,0
Look at the picture that's painted,0
Tainted as the mind who's blinded to the point,1
Where Sodomites get all the rights,1
We fall for fights with fisticuffs,0
Get pissed enough to miss the bus,0
It disgusts me to see my folks run up on,0
I say stand upon this section of time marked Revelations,0
And recognize this mind-numbing reality of horror,0
Known as mankind,0
Jesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen,1
A righteous number of righteous men,1
Even Judas the Betrayer came true in the end,1
The Devil say the end is the beginning,0
They teach that we were the product of incest,1
Invest no level of self into their system of,0
Paganomics,1
Stand with us and don't look back upon it,1
Just face this mindstate,1
Otherwise Babylon,1
[Hook: Debra Killings],0
Like memories of yesterday,0
"""Ninety-six gonna be that year""...",1
[Verse 1: André 3000],1
I bet you never heard of a playa with no game,1
"Told the truth to get what I want, but shot it with no shame",1
Take this music dead serious while others entertain,1
I see they're making their paper so I guess I can't complain,1
Or can I? I feel they're disrespecting the whole thang,1
Them hooks like selling dope to black folks,1
And I choke when the food they serving ain't tasting right,1
My stomach can't digest it even when I bless it,1
"I'm confessing one more lesson from the South, we in the house tonight",1
Now hootie who wants to oppose? Suppose,1
We rolls through Headland and Delowe,1
Where me and my niggas would pass the flow,1
And got down for ours like hind catchers,1
My mind catches flashbacks to the black past,1
While mind close niggas laugh at,1
"The Southern slang, finger waves and Mojo chicken wangs",1
I grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thang,1
"So go 'head and, diss it, while real hop-hippers listen",1
Started by Afrika Bambaata,1
", so you and your partner",0
Gather your thoughts,0
[Hook: Debra Killings],0
Something's gotta change,0
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain,0
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days,0
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way,1
Like memories of yesterday,1
[Verse 2: Big Boi],0
"Uhh, born Antwan Patton but my partners they call me Big Boi",1
"It's the nigga the B-I-G, be speaking the truth not talking that shit boy",1
I'm thinking of checking my traps and busting my raps,1
And throwing them craps,1
"7 Eleven is no convenience, you pumping your gas but watching your back",1
"For the robbing crew; thinking they're robbing you, you must be cautious",1
"To staying up on your game and pimping these crows, you must be flawless",1
"Like Mortal Kombat,",1
but fucking these wombats got you dizzy,1
My nigga you know if I wanna be playin,0
But runnin up on me like you miss me,0
"You catching the wrong vibe, packing your shit and rolling your eyes back",0
Flexin up on the corner tossin your dice and rollin your Cadillac,0
But man it seems I'm reaching out and touching the wrong nigga,0
Don't expect it to be pimping get your index off the trigger,0
"As we bust, us, we leavin em in the dust",1
So keep that caine up out of your nose,1
I said my piece and then I hush,0
"As the calendar keeps flippin', niggas dippin'",0
[Hook: Debra Killings],0
Something's gotta change,0
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain,0
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days,0
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way,0
Like memories of yesterday,0
[Verse 3: André 3000],0
"Our dearly beloved, we are gathered like soap is to lather we come clean",1
Some issues need to be addressed like envelopes I mean,1
"Oh, like Liberty Bells, yes them bullets keep on ringing",1
"On fire like the Georgia Mass Choir, we keep on sanging",1
Bringing our folks closer together cause they severed us from the get green,1
Light and we ain't gon' stop until we hit the big screen,1
"Psych, because no one is free when others are oppressed",1
"So, we hit the stage and then we fly back to our nest",1
Growing old,1
[Verse 4: Big Boi],0
"Like some eagles,",1
people don't understand,1
Just like their parents don't be caring,1
I'm speaking bout you playing with that phony stuff you sharing,1
In your raps Mercedes Benz and all your riches,1
"Thinking you got it but get it, get it but you ain't pimping no bitches",0
'Cause you flauging; falling like leaves into driveways,1
Isn't it lovely smoking good and sloppy head on highways,1
Fridays are tight but Saturday just makes it old,1
Winter nights are hot warm enough to feed your soul,1
Growing old,1

[Outro: André 3000],0
"See all them leaves must fall down, growing old",1
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab,1
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab,0
Trees bright and green turn yellow-brown,1
"Autumn caught em, see all them leaves must fall down, growin' old",1
"See all them leaves must fall down, growing old",1
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab,1
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab,0
Trees bright and green turn yellow-brown,1
"Autumn caught em, see all them leaves must fall down, growin' old",1

"Autumn caught em, see all them leaves must fall down, growin' old",1
