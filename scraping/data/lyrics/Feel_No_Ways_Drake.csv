"I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you",1
You got something that belongs to me,1
Your body language says it all,1
Despite the things you said to me,1
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?,1
Changin' your opinion on me,1
I was only gone for the last few months,1
But you don't have the time to wait on me,1
[Hook],0
I tried with you,1
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you,1
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do,1
And that just didn't sit right with you,1
"And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose",1
"Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose",1
"Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah",1
"And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it",1
"World's, world's, world's famous",1
"World's, world's, world's famous",1

"Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way",1
I've stopped listenin' to things you say,1
"'Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah",1
"Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way",1
Maybe we just should have did things my way,1
Instead of the other way,1
