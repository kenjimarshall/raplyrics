"I call the crib they say ""Breeze, you ain't know?""",1
"I say ""What?"" ""Big Time got popped in his Benzo!""",1
"I said ""Damn man, I'm riding in his Lexus",1
I'm 'bout to dump this nigga's shit in New Dimensions,1
Get to the crib so I can call Big Slate up,1
And tell 'em the money man done slipped and got his throat cut,1
And everything that we took from the warehouse,1
I heard somebody talkin' 'bout it at the White House,1
Man I thought you said that this job was for me and you,1
I ain't know that Bill Clampett wanted some too,1
You tell his folks that I'm sorry 'bout that Lexus,1
I'm 'bout to dip and see my sister up in...naaah!,1
Can't even tell you where I put my extra playa card,1
'Cause them Red Dog police know we homeboys,1
Just tell everybody who owe us a dime,1
It's the 'great ho 'round up yo' money' time,1
"I got to have mine, then I'm outta here!",1
"Take a loss, come back up just like Coco Grier",1
Ain't got to worry 'bout yo' partner getting caught like a lame,1
"It won't be over til' that big girl from Decatur sang""",1
(It won't be over till that big girl from Decatur sang!,1
East Point police don't know a damn thang...),1
[Verse 2: Big Boi],0
"Yeah, it won't be over, check this out",0
Can you see what I be hearing talking to spirits when I sleep?,0
"Peep this out real quick Slick, we gets on this beat and speak",1
"About that pimp shit, that walk with dat limp shit, that hemp shit",1
"Looking up in your face, I see a coward and a dimwit",1
Looking to run up in my private home just like you was the folks,1
"Serving a warrant to a baby daddy, who didn't come to court",1
"On a Tuesday, April Fool's Day, don't get caught slipping",0
"Leaving the keys off in the ignition, making me guilty by suspicion",0
Penny pinchers trying to stack for ninety-six,0
"Buying another Fleetwood, Diamond took it, so know we's in the mix",0
I need to take my ass to the crib and drop the baby off,1
'Cause them niggas at the corner sto' been looking at me for too long,1
Staring like accidents on highways,1
", high days are better than sober ones",0
"Don't be biased, but I know it has to come",0
So I put two in the sky to let them know I'm babysittin',1
"Y'all don't know nothin' 'bout Big Boi, 'cause that nigga steady dipping",0
It ain't over (why that? why that?) 'til the bitch open her mouth up,1
And sang,1
[Verse 3: Big Gipp],0
Took me a long time to get here,1
Long time man,1
"I'm talking about, years, and years",1
Riding past funeral fields holding bodies of my peers,1
If you don't educate yourself,1
Now how the fuck you gonna understand how you supposed to get paid?,1
Niggas walk around get with shade tree ass ways,1
"Fuck a fade, let my hair drag",1
Back and forth like a see-saw,1
"Jumping Lily, to lilypad dag",0
Looking to get my Goodie feel,1
I'm broke in like some old men,0
Who'd stop dem or would stop,0
I'm dropping lines for the big plot,0
Sixteen is when I started this dream,1
It's ninety-six I'm in your face,1
Can you hear that bitch scream?,1
(It won't be over til that big girl from Decatur sang...),0
