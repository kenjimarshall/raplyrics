I'm so motherfuckin' true like I'm 2 Chainz,1
Ridin' in that Mayweather with your boo thing,1
Every summer I pop up with some new chains,0
"In these Balmains, filled with them blue things",0
And these hoes on my back like my Fendi,0
You niggas need to E.N.D. the envy,0
And the troopers stop my car just to frisk me,0
"Big stash in it, they think that it's empty",0
[Verse 1],0
"When a real nigga talkin', please don't speak",0
My watch tried to take your bitch from me,0
"Dead 'mens in my pockets, all hunnid",0
"Bitch, I'm sippin' right now, don't even touch me",0
"No, I'm not sippin' slow",0
Just pass me the ball,0
I'ma pick and roll,0
I get that give and go,0
I'm out there gettin' dough,0
Sosa what's your goals? I don't really know,0
"But I know I want a new house, new shit, new money, new that",0
"New this, new thot, new bitch",0
Every time I have mood switch,0
"New Gucci, new Louis",0
"New shirts, new pants, new kicks",0
"New drink, new weed",0
I'm surrounded by a bunch of new shit,0
