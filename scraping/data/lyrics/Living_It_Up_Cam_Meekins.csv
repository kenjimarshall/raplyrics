[Chorus],0
Why you judging? We can't hear you,0
"I'm too high, you're in my rearview",0
"Keep on talking, we gon' get through",0
'Cause what's life without some issues?,0

[Verse 1],0
"I'm more than fly, I'm a pretty calm guy",0
I hear these people judging and I don't know why,0
"Is it, 'cause I can spit it on a level you can't get with?",0
Or maybe 'cause I stay up in your business getting digits,0
"Which is it, man? I ain't really trying to get it twisted",0
"I'm just living life, trying to do some things different",0
"I started as a fuck-up, was failing in class",0
"Now I'm trying to get my bucks up, preparing to blast",0
A couple mixtapes deep but Meek cannot sleep,0
"While you tryna count sheep, I'm gone 'til next week",0
"On a train, 'cause these rappers, they all lame",0
I'm just trying to chase my dreams while you trying to chase the fame,0
"Damn, I used to ball for my home team",0
"Now I ball on stage, making tour cream",0
It sure seems that I'm living out your dreams,0
"But you can make it too, that's a sure thing",0
[Chorus],0
Why you judging? We can't hear you,0
"I'm too high, you're in my rearview",0
"Keep on talking, we gon' get through",0

[Verse 2],0
All these self-conscious rappers bragging 'bout themselves,0
"Ayo, I tried to stay away but sometimes I can't help",0
"'Cause my mind is spinning, trying to get it so we winning",0
And also got the thought of graduating in a minute,0
"In the back of my mind, take you back to the time",0
"Where Casper just kicked it with drums, snare, clap, and I rhyme",0
"See, I'm the truthâ€”always spit it, matter of fact with my lines",0
"Give your change to the homeless, stop talking about dimes",0
"I'm, influenced by the most significant",0
"Flow like the Mississippi, smoke 'til I'm ignorant",1
And I don't give a shit about you bastards,0
I'ma pass on your raps like I took two classes,0
"I flow right past you, wishing on eyelashes",0
"God please, let me keep going, don't take me backwards",0
"Spoke to the captain, he gon' make it happen",0
"We gon' make it to the top, bitch, just ask him",0
[Chorus],0
Why you judging? We can't hear you,0
"I'm too high, you're in my rearview",0
"Keep on talking, we gon' get through",0

[Outro],0
"We gon' make it to the top this year (Yeah, yeah)",0
We gon' make it to the top this year,0
(We gon' make it to the top),0
We ain't never gonna stop this here,0
We ain't never gonna stop this here,0
(And we ain't never gonna stop),0
"We gon' make it to the top this year (Yeah, yeah)",0
We gon' make it to the top this year,0
We know,0
"And if my songs never drop, I swear",0
Then I'ma still be here in spirit,0
