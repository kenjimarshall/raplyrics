[Verse 1: Big Boi],0
"Well, it's the M-I-crooked letter coming around the South",1
Rolling straight Hammers and Vogues in that old Southern slouch,1
"Please, ain't nothing but incense in my atmosphere",0
"I'm bending corners in my 'Lac, boi",0
'Cause that's how we be rolling here,0
"Deep, the slang is in effect because it's Georgia",0
Kicking the khakis and Adidas,0
"Packing yo' heaters 'cause you 'sposed to, cousin",0
Catfish and grits is how my flow flows,1
Rolling steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go,1
"See, juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginning",1
Now I'm just a player sipping sauce every now and then,1
To catch a buzz like a bumble bee,1
Niggas who tried to fuck with me,1
Get sprayed like Raid 'cause it ain't nothing to see,1
[Verse 2: Andre 3000],0
My heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock,1
"No, my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid",1
Jump and you'll get too sprayed,0
Who raise yo' block? The one and only OutKast,0
"Many a nigga falling fast and I continue blasting, swiftly",1
"They ain't gon' get me, got something fo' em",1
The devil up in yo' grill and you still don't even know em,0
Show 'em who's the OK,0
"Like collard greens and Hoecakes, I got soul",0
That's something that you ain't got,0
That's why your style is rotâ€“ten,0
Stop in the land of ATL,0
Where nothing but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale,0
"Swell, swollen got my pockets, business booming like rockets",0
Folks try to stop it but they know that it's that,0
[Chorus: Choir],0
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music,1
"Now, players if you choose it",1
You better make sure you don't abuse it,1
"We gonna get cha high, high",1
[Verse 3: Andre 3000],0
Time to drop these 'bows like Dusty Rhodes,1
"Then I yell ""ho,"" and knock 'em up off they feet",1
Like a Southern hustler supposed to do,1
I's in the house like... a joint is lit for my kinfolks,0
And all the niggas that was down since we been broke,0
Taking 'em deeper than a submarine,0
So scream when you hear the team of two,0
"Look, my crew be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a Brougham",1
I'm packing my tag backwards if you want to be acting wrong,1
"Word is bond like super glue,",1
it's funky like poopa scoop,0
And every word I say you can true,0
[Verse 4: Big Boi],0
"Well, okey dokey, 'Kast out",1
I swear to God I got the highest booming Cadillac,1
"The expialalistic Coupe de Ville, can you handle that, you rat?",1
I take my time cruising 'round the city malls,1
And under my seat for you suckers is your final curtain call,0
"The one two to the gauge, P-U-M-P",0
"You want to do a jack, I heat the barrel 'til it's empty, get me?",0
"See, I ain't Finlay, getting in where I fit",0
Organized is on the track with the Southernplayalistic shit,1
So copy my slang and bite my shit but don't try gaffling me,1
'Cause sleeping you'll get served with some Southern hospitality,1
[Chorus: Choir],0
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music,1
"Now, players if you choose it",1
You better make sure you don't abuse it,1
"We gonna get cha high, high",1
[Verse 5: Big Boi],0
"Well, Southernplayalisticadillac music has been laid",0
"I may wait for all day and day, be rolling like that today, hoe",0
"So back up off it, get up on it if you want it, ya'll",0
"Looking for hoes and snitches was my thing on Player's Ball, yup",1
"So now I step, rather walk with the pimp limp",1
While my niggas are at East Point with that College Park hemp,0
Smoked out is how I wanna end it on this track,0
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac,0
[Verse 6: Andre 3000],0
"Step up in my shoes, you crews sitting on Trues",1
And Vogues for the hoes only when we rolling through,1
"Atlanta skies be blue, the sun is beaming, it's seeming",0
"That I'm glistening, rather gleaming",0
"20/20 got me leaning to the side, full of pride",1
Now ain't that something?,1
"I'm dipping into your hood, this ain't Braille, but I'm bumping",1
"Thumping out the roaches, Dungeon if y'all missed it",1
"Big Gipp, Goodie Mob, PA, OutKast, Southernplayalistic",1
[Chorus: Choir],0
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music,1
"Now, players if you choose it",1
You better make sure you don't abuse it,1
"We gonna get cha high, high",1
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music,1
"Now, players if you choose it",1
You better make sure you don't abuse it,1
"We gonna get cha high, high",1
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music,1
"Now, players if you choose it",1
You better make sure you don't abuse it,1
"We gonna get cha high, high",1
