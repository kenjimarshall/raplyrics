She don't believe in shootin' stars,1
But she believe in shoes and cars,1
Wood floors in the new apartment,0
Couture from the store's departments,1
"You more like ""love to start shit""",0
I'm more of the trips to Florida,0
"Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water",1
Straight from a page of your favorite author,1
And the weather so breezy,0
"Man, why can't life always be this easy?",0
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy,0
"I get a call like, ""Where are you, Yeezy?""",1
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte,1

And if somebody woulda told me a month ago,0
"Frontin', though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know",0
If somebody woulda told me a year ago,0
It'll go get this difficult,0
Feelin' like Katrina with no FEMA,1
Like Martin with no Gina,1
Like a flight with no Visa,1
"First class with the seat back, I still see ya",0
"In my past, you on the other side of the glass",1
Of my memory's museum,1
