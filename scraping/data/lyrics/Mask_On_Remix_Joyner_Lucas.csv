[Intro],0
Uh,0
"Joyner, Joyner, Joyner",0
Sober minds,1
Dead silence,1
"Yuh, listen, look",0
[Chorus],0
I don't take no fucking percocets,1
"Molly, Percocets",1
"No ecstasy, promethazine",1
"No lean, no purple mess",1
"No dirty Sprite but bitch, I got that Kyrie Irving step",1
"If you don't think that I'm the shit, it's just cause you ain't heard me yet",1
"I'm 'bout to put my mask on, my mask on",0
Stick all these industry niggas up until they cash gone,1
I know you high for the moment but that shit don't last long,1
I know you wasn't expecting this shit but you asked for it,0
[Verse 1],0
I'm about to grab niggas by the throat,1
I'm about to crash Lil Yachty boat,1
I'm about to drag niggas by the coat,0
"Take out your trash, sit it by the door",0
"Shit, I got the mask on me, I'm 'bout to go",0
I hate when niggas act funny when I'm alone,0
And try to give daps to me and tip their hats to me,0
And they act gully when they at home,0
"Yeah, I don't do Xannies or Mollys",1
Don't come near me with problems,0
And don't you compare me to Logic (never),1
Go listen to Sriracha,1
"Yeah, that's Amanda to Ronda",1
And that's a Benz to a Honda,1
"Yeah, that's a dance with the devil",1
And I ain't dancing behind ya,0
"My nigga, I'm a muthafucking entity",0
"You don't get it, even landlords gotta pay rent to me",1
Gingerbread man fuckers ain't catchin' me,1
"Sick and tired of niggas sickening, depressing me",0
"Go to church, I testify",0
Pray to God I bless the beat,0
"Kanye said ""Touch the Sky""",1
Future might come for me,1
"But I'm a fucking beast and if I die, that sucks for me",1
But where the crown I'ma kill the king,1
I bet a lot of haters won't feel the same,0
"I dug the ground, I built the ring",0
"I cut the cow I milked the game, nigga",0
I should cut a hole in the sky,0
"Make you feel the rain, nigga feel the pain, nigga",0
"A lot of rap niggas get nervous when they hear my name, nigga",0
"I'm insane, nigga",0
Back when you was watching Leave It To Beaver,1
I was crushing on Tila Tequila,1
I was swagging in Adidas and Filas,0
Fuckin' divas call 'em,0
"Venus, Serena",1
Signed my deal and told em Cesar's a beater,0
Hope you didn't think I needed you neither,0
Take it back and told 'em I didn't mean it,0
'Cause my uncle said it's cheaper to keep it,0
[Refrain],0
"Mask off, run in the back door",0
Blast y'all hats off,0
Fuck is you mad for?,0
"I catch y'all, smash y'all",0
Don't mean to laugh hard,0
But all you funny to me,0
None of you niggas half hard,0
You think you comin' for but you never could last long,0
You don't mean nothin' to me,0
And I come with some shit that'll make you niggas {Imitates mumble rap flow},1
Like that mumble rap shit (laugh),1
"Whoo, whoo!",0
"Mask off, run in the back door",0
Blast y'all hats off,0
Fuck is you mad for?,0
"I catch y'all, smash y'all",0
Don't mean to laugh hard,0
But all you funny to me,0
None of you niggas half hard,0
You runnin comin' for me but you never could last long,0
You don't mean nothin' to me,0
And I come with some shit,0
That'll make you niggas bump into me with a couple of weapons,0
"And be afraid to get it poppin', now they duckin' and dippin', I mean",0
What's up with you mumble niggas that never say nothin'?,0
I'm about to make all of you fuckers go to bed in the oven,0
I go to sleep with the devil and wake up next to your mother,0
And you ain't telling me nothing,0
I mean I'm very disgustin',0
I mean I'm ready to bust and,0
"Put an end to you fucker, now what's what?",0
How many CDs could a woodchuck chuck,1
If he chucked it at every single nigga that sucked?,1
Huh?,1
[Bridge],0
"Look, all you a lie",0
"I don't cuff no hoes, you can have my bitch",0
I don't even mind,0
It seems like all these hoes wanna do is switch up,0
They rather be a guy,0
If she could suck my dick everyday for a living,0
"Then that'd be her job, yuh",0
I said candy paint in yo fuckin' rims,0
.38 in yo fuckin' Benz,0
I was broke as fuck had a couple friends,0
A refrigerator and a cup of gin,0
"Let's drink it up, me and you",0
"'Cause these niggas fake, and I see it too",0
And they try to get me to pop Percocets and Molly,0
And I said,0
[Chorus],0
I don't take no fucking percocets,1
"Molly, Percocets",1
"No ecstasy, promethazine",1
"No lean, no purple mess",1
"No dirty Sprite but bitch, I got that Kyrie Irving step",1
If you don't think that I'm the shit its just cause you ain't heard me yet,0
"I'm about to put my mask on, my mask on",0
Stick all these industry niggas up until they cash gone,0
I know you high for the moment but that shit don't last long,1
