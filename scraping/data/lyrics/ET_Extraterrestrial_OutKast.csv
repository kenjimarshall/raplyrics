Peep what I say,1
Everyday the sun sets just like clockwork,1
To put the Glock to work,1
And putting the body to standstills,1
Man it kills me,1
Taking that life is like taking a shit,1
"Hit or miss, niggas are playing God",1
Trying to rob and steal,1
That's why ya gotta guard ya grill,1
Like a barbecue cause them harming you,1
Are just like honeybees swarming you,0
Vocally arming you was my responsibility,1
It's killing me thinking that all these niggas see they flauging,1
Thinking they Steven Seagal and balling,1
"Falling to the wayside when ya try to call, I've fallen",1
When we was little nappy headed niggas in the projects,1
"But now they carjacks, wait on income tax and unsafe sex",1
Still yet they tend to flex - like solo for tha lo-lo,0
"Smoke same thing -- no-no, not this time",0
Niggas around my way can rhyme,1
So fuck that country shit - we done a bunch of shit,1
And yes ya heard of this out of this world like E.T,1
Coming across ya T.V,0
Extraterrestrial - straight from ATL,1

"Right now I'm smiling, taking advantage of this moment",1
Cause there might not be another soon,1
Holding on to memories like roller coaster handle bars,1
Tightly cause I'm slightly off my rocker,1
But to you I may appear to be your average Joe,1
But little do you know that even Joe got problems that he gots to joust with,1
Floating in this game of life despite how out of place you may feel,1
In this race oh you just can't quit,1
Ain't that a bitch that be in heat,1
I'm on the beat like cops,1
Only cultivate the stable dirt when I skeet my drops,1
No concentrating knocking other niggas out the box,1
Why? Cause in a sense see we all be kind of fly,1
"Just can't be scared to spread your wings, head to better things",1
Maybe the mockingbird and nightingale they want to sing,1
"Keeping this thing alive, to the table's what we bring",0
We like hailstorms and blizzards in the middle of the spring,1
"Extraterrestrial, out of this world",1
