[Intro],0
I've been in my zone,0
Bitch I'm in my bag,0
I really don't know,0
How I got this swag,0
How I got the juice,0
I'm just gettin' loose,0
I'm just warmin' up,0
This ain't nothing new,0
[Verse 1],0
Right now I'm not really tryna wait,1
Wake up then I innovate,1
Wake up boy you fuckin' late,0
I'm just tryna step my cake,0
They just tryna ride my wave,1
Lately I've been makin' plays,1
"That's probably why they hate, but that's okay",1
"I'm sauced up, bossed up",1
"I can't take a loss, yuh",1
"Tryna get a mil but until then I ain't gon stop, yuh",1
"Admit it that I'll keep on working, understand that I'm not perfect",1
"What you want to get out of life you deserve it, put that work in",0
"Make it happen, I know that it's kinda hard to trust your passion",0
"But you can do it, I know that, keep movin' forward don't go back",0
Up the only way I go,0
I feel like Pablo,1
I'm an icon like Kanye,1
I lead the path come follow hi-low,0
Friendships I don't fuck with,0
"Don't like me, well that's tough shit",0
I'ma hit the beat like a drum stick,0
Don't catch me on that dumb shit,0
I know some people ain't gon' like me (why?),0
Just cause I'm different and there ain't nobody like me (okay),0
"Pull up to the scene, lookin' clean in my white tee (in my white tee)",0
"Bitch say I'm the greatest to do it, okay I might be (okay I might be)",0
"Yeah, okay I might be (yeah, I might be)",0
That's just how I'm livin' that's the vision,0
I got to much sauce the way I'm drippin' (skrrt skrrt),0
[Chorus],0
I got too much sauce how I'm drippin' these days,1
"I've been glowin' up, that's how I'm livin' these days",1
"Hatin' on me then, now you tryna ride my wave",1
You can see it in my face I didn't come to play games,1
Got too much sauce how I'm drippin' these days,1
"I've been glowin' up, that's how I'm livin' these days",1
"I do it for the love, you just do it for the fame",1
But that's some bullshit,1
Bitch get out my way,1
[Bridge],0
Bitch get out my way,0
Stay up out my lane,0
"Too much on my brain, I think I will go insane",0
"Okay now I keep it sane, I've been wildn' out",0
"I was feelin' down (skrrt), but I'm smilin' now (skrrt)",0
"I've been in my zone, bitch I'm in my bang",0
"I really don't know, how I got this swag",0

I know she gon' love me now,0
Cause she heard I'm poppin' on the ground (brrrt),0
"I'm just getting started, trust me I got bigger plans",0
People always gonna hate on things that they don't understand,0
I'm tryna travel the world they like New York to Birmingham,0
I just copped a flight,0
"Tell me to stop, I might, psych bitch I can't do dat",0
"Psych bitch, no way I can do dat",0
"Okay, my future bright, (okay)",0
Ballin' on them like Mike (oh yuh!),0
"And you know I never stop, I'm just tryna count this guap",0
Do it for the culture like I'ma be know you feel me when I hit the beat,0
"Don't need to accept defeat, just doin' me I don't compete",0
Don't know my flow so cold so sick I think I need a remedy,0
Go pick up the vibes and energy that be the rest of me,0
[Chorus],0
I got too much sauce how I'm drippin' these days,0
"I've been glowin' up, that's how I'm livin' these days",0
"Hatin' on me then, now you tryna ride my wave",0
You can see it in my face I didn't come to play games,0
Got too much sauce how I'm drippin' these days,0
