"I tell all Spanish bitches, dímelo",1
She say it's for her and not for me to know,1
She always wanna know why I don't let her roll,1
"So shit, just say for you it's just for me to know",1
I said the faces in my Rollie never tick tock,1
Stacking paper 'til it's at the tip top,1
"I know why they mad, 'cause my shit pop",1
Driving to success so fuck a pit stop,1
Swear I did it all for some Adidas,1
I'm the one that said fuck any non-believers,1
"Homeboy, I know you love to think you fucking with me",1
"Just keep it real my G, who really run the city",1
Fargo got 'em bunch of bitches in the Caravan,1
Step off in your bitches like a pair of Vans,1
Damn this white bitch with me look like Marilyn,1
My life just like a movie that'll never end,1
[Pre-Chorus],0
"And it's all in one night, since everyone's around",0
We brought everyone up out of their home for a night,0
So let's get right,0
[Chorus],1
I got Hispanic bitches yelling dímelo,1
I'm the one that's living shit la vida loca,1
Toasting to my niggas 'cause we finally made it,1
"Crazy, we did everything we dreamed of",1
"I know I deserve it, I know I deserve it",1
Put your hands up if you deserve it,1
"I know I deserve it, I know I deserve it",1
Put your hands up if you deserve it,1

Tell them niggas to drop a O in a ziplock,1
"Tell the competition, wait",0
"I forgot, no competition, I got shit locked",0
I got big plans for some big guap,1
"Girl, these niggas sayin I'll be rich",0
I been plotting on that shit since '96,0
"If I go reaching for a fail, I'll probably miss",0
The realest song of the year is probably this,0
"I see these niggas talk so down about a nigga, man",1
But you know that I'm rich and I don't give a damn,1
Ride around the town in that 911,1
And she say she don't want this shit to ever end,1
[Pre-Chorus],0
"And it's all in one night, since everyone's around",0
We brought everyone up out of their home for a night,0
So let's get right,0
[Chorus],1
I got Hispanic bitches yelling dímelo,1
I'm the one that's living shit la vida loca,1
Toasting to my niggas 'cause we finally made it,1
"Crazy, we did everything we dreamed of",1
"I know I deserve it, I know I deserve it",1
Put your hands up if you deserve it,1
"I know I deserve it, I know I deserve it",1
Put your hands up if you deserve it,1
