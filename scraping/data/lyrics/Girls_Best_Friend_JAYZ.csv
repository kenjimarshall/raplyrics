"C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?)",0
Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing),0

[Verse 1: Jay-Z],0
I took ya outta Jacob's in clusters,1
Busters they wanted to rush us,1
Love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya,1
When you blush you turn blue if your grade is right,0
"You can light up the whole room, turning day from night",0
When the summertime is in and the tops are down,0
With you around my neck we lock the whole block down (that's right),0
It took short sleeves and lounging to understand,0
"The reason they call you ice, everybody freeze",1
Ain't a pendant in the sun who can shine like you,1
And that platinum in the charm who can blind like you,1
The direct reason why niggas do they crimes they do,1
I used to snatch the necklace right off them reckless fools,1
Guess I was jealous that they was so next to you,1
So I devoted half my time to invest in you,0
The other half was spent on protecting you,0
"'Cause you belong to me, now sing ya song for me",0
C'mon,0
[Chorus: Mashonda (Jay-Z)],0
"C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?)",0
Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing),0
Hold me tight and call me your lady (say it louder),0
Make me scream your name,0
"C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?)",0
Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing),0
Hold me tight and call me your lady,0
Make me scream your name,0
[Verse 2: Jay-Z],0
"I'm often with you, so they wonder 'bout the juice I got",1
I took you from the projects and an abusive pops,1
From the bottom to the top,0
The skateboard to the drop,0
From the nada to the Prada,0
I got ya like I got ya,0
From the first time I put you round my neck and locked ya,0
It was then I knew everywhere I went you'd follow,0
"Soon I spent every dollar, you became my habit",1
"Other brothers vice was smoke, mines was carats",1
The more checks I got the more I laced my crew,1
"The rocks got bigger, watch face got blue",0
"Tricked a little bit, shit I lace my boo",1
"Fuck it, my mistress I laced her too",1
"Cop my jewels twice, like déjà vu",1
"If they ever met in the mall, it was over y'all",1
"Just the way I do, and either way you win",0
I mean the thugs love ya when you're girl's best friend,0
[Chorus: Mashonda (Jay-Z)],0
"C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?)",0
Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing),0
Hold me tight and call me your lady,0
Make me scream your name (and all my ladies sing),0
"C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?)",0
Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing),0
Hold me tight and call me your lady,0
Make me scream your name,0
[Verse 3: Jay-Z],0
"Yeah, yeah, yeah",0
"In the wedding band you love, in the gold chain you thug",0
Sometimes you given just because,0
And the tennis bracelet means they want relations,0
"Know that they wanna fuck, the only reason they give you up",0
In the hands of gold diggers you never enough,0
"Rings, things, just never enough",0
But me and you together gon' shine to the end,0
"I mean the thugs love ya, but ya girl's best friend",0
[Chorus: Mashonda (Jay-Z)],0
"C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy",0
Don't want nobody but you my baby,0
Hold me tight and call me your lady,0
Make me scream your name,0
"C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?)",0
Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing),0
Hold me tight and call me your lady,0
Make me scream your name,0
"C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy",0
Don't want nobody but you my baby,0
