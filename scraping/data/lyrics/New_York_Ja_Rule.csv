Slugs flying at the speed of sound,1
Tryin to catch the ears of niggas that's running their mouths,0

Like them little motorcycles,1
Stick up kids hoppin' out with them old rifles,0
"Just doing shit for nothin', it's so spiteful, ha, I'm just like you",0
Word that niggas wanna murk you is in the air,0
A double shot of 'gac,1
