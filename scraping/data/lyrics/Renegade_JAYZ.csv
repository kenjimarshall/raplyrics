"Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (Bling bling)",1
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?,1
"See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined",0
"The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'",1
"What I do, through and through and",1
"I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view",1
"The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture",0

I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' round,0
"Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways",0

"But if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth, grin and bear it",0
"Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?",1
"Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics",1
"Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?",0
"But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it",1
"Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit",0
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish,0
"But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America",1
"As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?",1
"Nah, nah!—That's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror",0
"And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed",0
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents,0
"You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Ha-ha!)",1
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?,0
"I don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo",0
"‘Cause, here we go; he's Jigga-Jur-Jigga-Jih-Jigga",1

We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is,1
