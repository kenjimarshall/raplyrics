"You wouldn't do that Tyler, kill yourself or anyone. You don't even have the balls to begin with. What you need is me, someone to talk to, uh, it's been a while since our last session. So, tell me what's been going on",1
[Verse 1],0
I'm not a fucking role model (I know this),1
I'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams,1
Since Kanye tweeted telling people he's bumping all of my shit,1
These mothafuckas think I'm 'sposed to live up to something? Shit,0
I'm still jacking off and proceeding my life careless,0
But getting more pussy 'cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (as you should),1
"Philly to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares",0
"At skateparks and airports all in a year, it's weird",0
Yonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked,0
Now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked,0
He still hasn't called me yet,0
(that's not your fault),0
"But that's a whole fucking different argument, shit, I got over it",0
"And a couple bucks in my pocket, so now I could go buy",1
A couple hot pockets and grandma could stop cooking,1
"Them nasty ass collard greens,",1
pressure's on me like this top hat,0
"Bastard intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that?",1
"[Interlude: Tyler The Creator,",0
"Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC",0

"""Tyler, you'll top it, you'll top that, you're a very capable individual""",0
"""Okay, you guys caught me, I'm not a fucking rapist or serial killer, I lied""",0
"""You know, you just want attention, you'll be fine""",0
"""I try too hard, huh?""",0
"""No, you don't""",0
[Verse 2],0
Made a couple thou' and I just don't know what to buy yet,0
The 'preme shit is free,1
"and I don't drink, so fuck a wine set",0
"Nigga, fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity",0
"I'm fucked in the head, I lost my mind with my virginity",0
"Oh, that's a triple three six, isn't he a devil worshiper",1
Cause I'm too fucking ignorant to do some research?,1
I'm the star of the group,0
(Yeah),0
So no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you,0
(Bastard was good though),0
What you think I record it for?,0
To have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?,0
"Like I didn't make ""Parade"" or ""Inglorious""",0
Cause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel?,0
Of course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off,1
"In the tombs of Lara Croft,",1
I'm getting pissed off,0
(I bet),0
"Message boards are on my dick, I need a pissing waiver",0
(here),0
"Let me bust one in they mouth,",0
I know they full of flavor,1

"""Can't they just be happy for me like, a kid with nothing, living out his dreams? Why they got to fucking hate?""",0
"""I think everyone's happy, everyone's immature, everyone loves you Tyler, you have to believe that.""",0
"""I don't even skate anymore, I'm too fucking busy, I can barely kickflip now.""",1
"""Why? Why is that? Do you not have any free time at your home?""",0
"""What the fuck you mean I'm not talented? You see the shit that I've been doing?""",0
"""I have, I mean you're a great person.""",0
"""I mean, I'm not that great of a rapper but as a whole, I'm pretty cool, right?""",0
[Verse 3],0
"People excited, thinking shit is so tight",0
(For what?),0
Getting co-signs from rappers that I don't even like,0
What the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic?,0
And start Jackson him off until his cack blasting off?,0
(No...),0
"Fuck that,",0
(Yeah),0
These niggas ain't fucking with me,0
Cause I don't listen to the Immortal of Tech-of-the-nique,1
And all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak,0
On the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week,0
I'd rather listen to Badu and Pusha the T,1
And some Waka Flocka Flame instead (All that shit) of that real hip hop,1
"That's bull-of-the-sheet,",0
but they want to critique,1
"Everything that we, Wolf Gang, has ever released",1
"But they don't get it,",0
"(They don't, it's not made for them)",0
cause it's not made for them,0
"The nigga that's in the mirror rapping, it's made for him",1
But they do not have the mindset that's same as him,1
"I'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him",1

[Verse 4],0
Therapy's been sinning and niggas getting offended,0
They don't want to fuck with me cause I do not fuck with religion,0
"You see, that's my decision, you fuckers don't have to listen",0
"Here, put this middle finger in your ear",0
(I'd rather not),0
When someone gets blamed cause some white kid had aimed (What?) his AK-47,1
"At 47 kids, I don't wanna see my name mentioned",1
(I don't think anyone's going to menâ€”I don't think anyone takes you serious enough to believe you.),0
College wasn't working and I wasn't working,0
So I was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting,0
"But I was determined to be great, so those classes can wait",0
"Cause the four days that I went, I wasn't learning shit",0
"(I mean, you...)",0
Now I'm living dreams that I wanted since eight,0
And can afford to get my mother something on her birthday,0
"(I mean, you've explained to me that you were in school, but, I mean, I...)",0
They claim the shit I say is just wrong,0
Like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone,0
"I'm just a teenager, who admits he's suicide prone",0
"My life is doing pretty good, so that date is postponed for now",0
"Wow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen",1
"And when she gives you lemons, nigga, throw 'em at pedestrians",1
"(So, what are you saying, take advantage?
I mean, you've been doing pretty good, I've seen that)",0
I still live in my grandma's house,0
Sell out a fucking show in London just to end up on couches,1
"I hate my fucking life, but when I make that announcement",0
"My hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then",1
And then I am confused if I want in or just out,0
My friends really think I'm playing when I say I need counseling,0
I sit in grandmother's living room and just pout,0
"And shout loud inside, sometimes I just want to die",0
"(No, you don't)",0
Odd Future came from the bottom,0
And it's gonna take a couple armed armies tryna stop 'em,0
(I believe you),0
All you fucking lames don't have to like me,0
"The devil doesn't wear Prada, I'm clearly in a fucking white tee",1
