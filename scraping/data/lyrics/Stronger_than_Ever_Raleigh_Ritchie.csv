[Verse 1],0
"Hate me when I'm gone, I'll make it worth your while when I'm successful",1
But when I'm here I need your kindness cause the climb is always stressful,0
Clumsily gassed myself by thinking I'll be better off alone,1
I'll leave my peace in pieces all around the decent people back at home,1
[Chorus],0
"'Cause I'm a big boy, an adult now, well nearly",0
If I pull the wool back from my eyes I can see clearly,1
"The world is at my feet and I am standing on the ceiling, oh",0
"And I fall, fall, fall, when it all comes down",0
And I won't be crushed by the weight of this town,0
I fall from the sky but I won't fall forever,1
I fall but when I'll rise I'll be stronger than ever,1
[Verse 2],0
"Official man, delusions grand, now I'm a free agent",1
I'm here to make a stand for causes I don't understand and make a statement,1
"I fall short on knowledge, I don't even watch the news",1
"Can't be arsed with college, it's nothing but a human zoo",1
[Chorus],0
"'Cause I'm a big boy, an adult now, well nearly",0
If I pull the wool back from my eyes I can see clearly,1
"The world is at my feet and I am standing on the ceiling, oh",1
"And I fall, fall, fall, when it all comes down",0
And I won't be crushed by the weight of this town,0
I fall from the sky but I won't fall forever,1
I fall but when I'll rise I'll be stronger than ever,1
[Verse 3],0
"I'm not defeated, I believe that I can turn this ship around",0
Destroy the status quo until I know I found a common ground,0
"I'm not alone, I'm just focused in my zone, this is easy",0
"I'm fine, I just need time to turn this into home, I'm good, believe me",0
Believe me when I say I'm gonna be,0
[Bridge],0
Big explosions crack through thunderous mountains,0
"Hearts exploding, minds, volcanoes pop and blow",0
"I'm not alone, I'm not alone",0
"Who am I kidding? I'm sad, no ideas coming",0
It's driving me mad and I'm fighting,0
"It's turning me bad, I'm loaded, rage is taking me over",0
I just wanna be home with all my friends and family,0
"Mum and dad, it's closing in on me, I need recovery, coming home",0
"I'm coming home and I need closure, I need closure",0
[Chorus],0
"'Cause I'm a big boy, an adult now, well nearly",0
If I pull the wool back from my eyes I can see clearly,1
"The world is at my feet and I am standing on the ceiling, oh",0
"And I fall, fall, fall, when it all comes down",0
And I won't be crushed by the weight of this town,0
I fall from the sky but I won't fall forever,1
I fall but when I'll rise I'll be stronger than ever,1
