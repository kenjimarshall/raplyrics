[Verse 1: Joba],0
"Pretty sure I'm maniacal, but what do I know?",1
"I don't know, all I know is what I see through my monocle",1
"That and the telescope, keep one lens on the money flow",1
"The other's gold and complemental trusty, well, well",1
I'm rolling down hills in a suit through the mud,1
Throw my dress shoes in a fire with the woods,1
Sit back and relax with the fumes of,1
Everything I hate in the world,1
"Play Mozart, smoke my cigar on",1
"My estate, keep the cars parked on the front lawn",1
"Neighbors hate,",1
place duct tape underneath their tires,1
And I wait,1
[Verse 2: Dom McLennon],0
Sun sets to blood moon horizons,1
Left brain and right brain divided,1
Set frames and watch plays inside them,0
In the mountains now's where you'll find him,0
I smell a breeze in the morning,0
"I feel your presence, it's warming",0
I paid attention to warnings,0
But we were too caught up in transforming,0

"Lucky days, I'm burnin' the four-sil",0
Your boy is dusty like brush up a fossil,0
Hear that shit,0
urk,0
like the noise of a possum,0
"Bitch, I'm a king, I was born in the castle",0
"Built like a boxer, I'm ready to tussle",0
"Fuck on my baby, I'm ready to bust one",0
Come fuck with me and my dogs,0

"That boy stay light like a cheerleader, um",0
"She want me filled like a two litre, um",0
"Eat it all day, watch it ricochet off",0
"Then I skrrt off on that Michelin, aw",1
They don't got nothing on me 'til I pop,0
"They don't got nothing on me, call the cops",0
"I hit that run like a Heisman boy, run it back",1
"Look at that boy, hit that running back",1
[Verse 4: Merlyn Wood],0
"Shout out to South Central, San Marcos",1
I got addicted to soft shell tacos,1
Right after panties and ramen noodles,0
Now I see how I'm gon' make a shooter,0
"Stamina, stamina!",0
I used to be holding the camera,0
"Head through the glass, throw your window up",0
Start praying to me like my handle Cortana,0
We like Wu-Tang but I feel like Santana,1
Sweet talkin' just like she Hannah Montana,1
"Head was clean, Tony Fantano...",1
Made her my wife-a,0
She can't eat 'cause she's so Bella,1
Confused erection,0
"Bad hoes, no name, brand slave, brainless",0

"Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to",1
