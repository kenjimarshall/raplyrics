[Verse 1: Stormzy],0
"See, I love my hood, but the hood shit bugs me",1
Cuh' man ah put the chrome to my mum,0
Then they see me and spud me,0
And plus I got childhood friends that are schemin' to rush me,0
So if I just pack my bags and I leave this fuckery,1
"Look, nobody judge me",1
Now I'm just picturing charms all dressed in white,0
On the steps with Christ,0
Tryna tell my young Gs to relax and invest in life,0
They invest in knives,0
"Man, I was in my history class when my bredren died",1
So vexed that I cried,0
But I come from a place where the mandem can't let shit slide,0
So we rest in pride,0
"And it kills us slow, but, bro, I don't need all that",0
'Cuh the place where I live is the place I will die,0
But I already preed all that,0
"Can't chat about pain, just look at my veins",0
"Look brudda, I bleed all that",0
"Damn, I just want all my people back, yo",0
[Chorus: Raleigh Ritchie],0
In case you think I've changed and I'm different,0
I'm not keeping you at a distance,0
"So have a thought for me, yeah",0
"Hold down this floor for me, yeah",0
Remember the time before things changed? Back in the day,0
Everything can stay the same,0
Remember I came? Remember my name?,0
Remember my face? I don't wanna fade away,0
[Post-Chorus: Raleigh Ritchie],0
"Don't cry for me, don't cry for me, oh no, no, no",0
"Don't cry for me, don't cry for me",0
Don't cry for me,0
[Verse 2: Stormzy],0
"Yo, heart on my sleeve, let me open up",0
TBTs on the block all posted up,0
Me and them boy don't mix but I'll post it up,0
And it ain't no family pic but it's close enough,0
"And look man, I still reminisce when I'm holdin' up",0
I think about the past sometimes and I sober up,0
"'Cause if that boy looks back, it'll hold him up",0
Man are out here beefin' like we ain't broke enough,0
Swear these bruddas ain't woken up,0
Like what have I done to deserve this life?,0
I got brothers in the pen that I'll never see again,0
Got my brothers dem servin' life,1
And I know that you think that it serves 'em right,1
But I come from a place where you burn or die,1
Or we turn and ride,0
"So don't blame us when we turn to the dirt, we tried",0
"I just pray we fly, yo",0
[Chorus: Raleigh Ritchie],0
In case you think I've changed and I'm different,0
I'm not keeping you at a distance,0
"So have a thought for me, yeah",0
"Hold down this floor for me, yeah",0
Remember the time before things changed? Back in the day,0
Everything can stay the same,0
Remember I came? Remember my name?,0
Remember my face? I don't wanna fade away,0
[Outro: Raleigh Ritchie],0
Don't cry for me,0
Just take a shot for me,0
"Don't cry for me, yeah, yeah, yeah",0
"Don't cry, oh no",0
"Don't cry for me, no",0
