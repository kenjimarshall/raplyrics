"Greetings, earthlings",1
[Verse 1: Big Boi],0
From the bottom of my lungs a nigga be blowing,1
Spitting his game,1
"Coming up on ya from the South, the A-T-Liens ain't changed",1
Cooler than most players claim to be,1
A nigga that's from the A-Town see,1
The home of the Bankhead Bounce,1
Campbellton Road and other city streets,1
"Enough of the verality, fallacy, butter we speak not fiction",0
Speaking of pulling yo girl looking at Jheri curls you bitches,1
"Everytime I rhyme for y'all, I'm looking to prove a point",1
Kicking a freestyle every now and then,1
But mostly off the joint,1
"See I smoke good cause see it go good wit them flows, bwoi",1
The nigga the B-I-G like Tony Rich nobody knows why,1
"But me and my folks, cause y'all niggas jokes like the Joker",1
I'm sick of these wack ass rappers like I'm tired of hoes in chokers,1

Who them boys that be having it crunk every occasion,1
"This side niggas dusting, that side niggas lacing",1
"But in the middle we stay calm, we just drop bombs",1
Asking where we come from? South Post slums,0
It's just two dope boys in a cadillac,1
It's just two dope boys in a cadillac,1
[Verse 2: André 3000],0
This ol' sucka MC stepped up to me,1
Challenged André to a battle and I stood there patiently,1
"As he spit and stumbled over cliches, so called freestyling",1
"Whole purpose just to make me feel low, I guess you wilding",1
"I say, ""Look, boy, I ain't for that fuck shit—so fuck this""",1
"""Let me explain 'only child' style so you don't dis'""",1
I grew up to myself not round no park bench,1
Just a nigga busting flows off in apartments,1

We cutting the fool now,0
I'm doing ya at the house and throwing you out because I'm through now,1
"Don't you love the way we claiming Bankhead, stankhead",1
Looking around the SWATS for the herb that's never tainted,1
Fainted when you heard the burban serving on the block,0
And all you biting individuals need to check yourselfs and stop,1

Now tricks be looking at me like I'm they way up out the projects,1
"Can't put you on my payroll, and no I ain't got no Rolex",1
"Or no diamond; at the exit with a sign saying ""We'll rap for food""",1
My face is bawled up cause I ain't in a happy mood,1
While my partner got the squeegee and the Windex,1
'Cause somewhere in my life I done went wrong just like a syntax error,1
Bring the terror to your dome like PE,1
Prone to finish this out cause this be a freestyle,1
