Hahahaha!,0
Oh you gon' highlight shit? (Hahaha),0
Gon' get jealous like shit? (Hahahaha),0
I hope you record it like shit? (Hahaheheheha),0
'Cause I am GRVTY like shit? (Hehe fuck),0
"And I am, [?] tight",0
"Wait, wait, are you recording?",0
And to immediately get into our show,1
I want to bring out the host of tonight's show,1
You all know him,1
"A very wonderful, wonderful personality of show business",1
[Verse 1: Logic],0
Now ain't it funny how the whole thing changed,0
"They said I'd never make it, now their words rearranged",0
I went from nothing to something,0
But I was something all along,0
Who you know on the come-up doing numbers in Hong Kong,0
"Got fans in LA, got fans in NY",0
Got fans down in Atlanta and all the way to the Chi',0
We world wide (World wide),0
World wide motherfucker,0
They think we pay for promotion but our strength is in numbers,0
"This is so comical, so hilarious",0
All these stupid groupie bitches want to marry us,0
"And just a year ago, I had to pay to perform",0
And now venues across the country dropping stacks to go on,0
I've been working for years and sometimes I get heated,0
But those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it,1
I do it for the fans,0
They know what the message is,0
"RattPack is world wide, don't believe it? Check the messages",0
[Interlude: Fans],0

[Verse 2: Logic],0
And now I'm back but I'ma switch the style up,0
"We moving at high speed, these fuckers are dialed up",1
You know I formulate my words like a dissertation,0
So let a brother proceed like litigation,0
"I know you feel this deep inside of you, no penetration",0
We got something for everybody but in moderation,0
You gotta crawl 'fore you walk,0
I ball but you block,0
Share knowledge like it's stocks,0
Since the West Deer Park,1
Back in the days and the 9 millimeter strays that grazed,1
My old apartment,1
To wherever I dreamed that's where my heart went,0
"Now, as a baby my Mama was on the bottle",0
Couldn't wait 'til I was of age to hit the lotto,1
Or the throtto and I'm gone,0
Like fuck the world,0
All I had was music and my girl,0
'Til that shit fell apart and this life unfurled,0
"Nevertheless, I atest and ""Am I blessed?"" Hell yes",0
"Occasional stress, but I only bite what I can digest",0
Back in the day it was jeans and white tee's,0
Now that I got all the sponsors I can keep up with the companies,0
Now I'm not bragging about material possessions,0
I'm trying to teach you a lesson about business and progression,0
And what happens when you perfect the image in your profession,0
"Ain't no second guessing, you know it's all about perception",0
I used to talk about the things I wasn't really doing,0
But I had to visualize it before I began pursuing it,0
"Yeah, huh, and now a motherfucker doing it",0
"But business aside, it's been a beautiful ride",0
'Cause I do it for the fans and brush the haters aside,0
I can't wait for the day I'll look within the eyes of my bride,1
'Cause every lion needs its queen to make its children its pride,1
but,0
These haters really don't know what the message is,0
(Message is),0
Don't know what the message is,0
"Once again, don't believe it? Check the messages",0
