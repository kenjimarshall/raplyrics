So give yourself a hand,1
"No, no, give yourself a hand",1
Better pose for that camera,1
"Better pose, boy you better pose",1

I don't know if you'll handle it well,1
Welcome to hell camp,1
"(Lights, and the camera, and the action)",1
You should be mine in a way tonight,1
"(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)",1
