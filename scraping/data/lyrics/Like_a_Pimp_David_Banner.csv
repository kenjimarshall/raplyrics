By the time I hit the door I saw hoes on the floor,0
Niggas dressed in suits trickin' all they dough,0
"Me? I'm a pimp, I ain't paying for no sex",0
Man I'd rather buy a car or a new Rolex,0
'Cause I got street fame so hoes flock like birds,0
"I got one holdin' the weed, I got one holdin' the syrup",0
"When I hit the club, I'ma be with David Banner",0
A thug ass nigga with bad table manners,0
"We act bad, my nigga what is y'all saying?",0
Like when we walk inside clubs niggas hold they gal hand,1
Cause they know we run trains (choo! choo!) all night,1
How could your gal leave me and be with you all night?,1
"But it's all right, cause you know we don't kiss",1
"Like Too Short said, ""Bitches ain't shit""",0

Michael Tyler made you shake and Sisqo made you show your thong,1
"Bitch I'm dead wrong, been playa from the crib",0
So get out on the floor girl and get it how you live,0
"And since you so hot, fuck it, show your pussy lips",0
"You go to Tougaloo, but I know you still flip",1
"Bitch, don't trip! Ain't a damn thing changed",0
I still love my queen but bitches hip me to the game,0
