[Intro],0
"Now, I don't ever wanna hear you niggas say you doubtin' shit again",0
[Verse],0
"Look, look",0
"Fake niggas, don't show me love",0
"And all you fake bitches, I don't want yo hugs",0
I got this pistol and a gang of hundreds,0
"In this drop Mercedes-Benz, gettin' dumb blunted",1
Don't be surprised if you don't get what you never wanted,0
I'm on my fifth fly whip while you ain't never stunted,0
"Never going broke, funny 'cause I never budget",0
Lotta niggas 'round now that I ain't never fucked with,0
"That's why I'm in and out of town, out in other countries",0
"It's like the less I come around, the more I get money",0
And I been catching wind lately that the feds want me,0
"But I'm gon' keep getting rich, so it's gon' get ugly",0
Told my mama I'ma gang bang graduate,0
"Pioneered the transition from this Crippin' wasn't easy nigga, but I mastered it",0
That's why I still deliver raps so passionate,0
"Built my own lane, ain't no nigga ever hand me shit",1
"Slauson Avenue, do you understand the averages?",1
The fact I'm still standing speaks volumes to my savages,1
We lust lavishness and aim for extravagance,0
Even if it's only temporary,0
'Least we had the shit,0
I press the gas 'til one-60 on the dash is hit,0
My bitch lit the blunt and passed the shit,0
"Look, iPhone 4s and life on tour",0
"Get five racks every night, what's the price on yours?",0
"I'm down to splurge on my bitch, 'cause I don't wife no whores",0
Get the whole fall collection if she like that store,0
"Baby, rhyme crazy, that's just how this life made me",0
"Trust funds for Emani, in case this life take me",1
"I live it to the fullest, never let this life break me",0
Thus far it's been a cold demonstration,0
"Number one question now is, ""Did the fame the change me?""",0
"Fuckin' right young nigga, should I be still gang bangin'?",0
"Wait, hold up, hold that thought, take these shots",0
And tell my niggas S.I.P. The Marathon don't stop,0
"Before I sell my soul, I give my life",0
"It's been a minute but we gon' get right, watch..",0
[Bridge],0
I'm out here on a mission and I'm all alone,0
I'm far from where I'm going and I'm far from home,0
Somehow I know I'm moving in the right direction,0
Mama always told me I was gon' be special,0
