"More of the same, I'm cornered again",0
"Back and forth, forth and back with the names",1
Recordin' pain,1
You played back when them insecurities rang,1
"And I ain't even gotta answer, but the question remain",1
Why everything inside of my brain,1
"Not applied, it's insane",1
"But, yo, I'm tryna change",1
Decided to ditch my strength and rely on the King,1
Mama said at the end of yourself is where it begin,1
"So I'm totally freed, embracin' my limitations",1
Wishin' my heart move at the same pace as this information,0
I pray this ain't strange what I'm sayin',1
But I'm tryna find a back door to your imagination,1
"I'm here, let me in to be clear",1
I'm bringin' somethin' make you wonder who's the one that gave the gifts that I bear,0
What happen next,0
"I think about it, do you ever?",1
I can give you an answer but a question do you better like..,1
[Hook: Dimitri McDowell],0
Have you ever loved the treasures of this world,1
When it's insanity?,1
Cause it's killin' me,1
Have you ever tried to be something you're not?,1
Cause I've been searching for security,1
"Oh, na-na-na",1

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo],0
I'm tryna go from selfish to selfless,1
Not just thinkin' 'bout my needs but someone else's,1
All these pretty women in my city isn't helpin',1
"No matter how hot that body, one day it's meltin', yo",1
A good lie got a little truth in it,0
So I'm tryna decide what's real and embellished,0
The money comin' in so everybody's good fellas,1
"I don't trust em, no phone numbers",0
Tell em e-mail us,0
Can you tell?,0
I've been affected by this industry,0
"Numbers and CD sales, what the heck has gotten into me?",0
"I had to ask myself, what's a win for me?",0
Do I worship God or what other people think of me?,1
Soberin' thoughts depletin' my hot air,1
Thinkin' 'bout this world when I'm not here,1
Will I treasure money or the moments that we share?,1
"It's funny how, seein' death can make life so clear",1
"I got a girlfriend, but so long it feels weird",1
"It's not like ""Yo, can I get to know you?""",1
"More like, ""Meet my parents""",1
I think I'm scared cause it's serious,1
And every time I tell somebody they tryna to marry us,1
Pump the brakes,1
"I think I love her, but them words ain't been said still",0
Cause last time I did things didn't end well,0
"Plus, plus my past was hashtag been trill",1
"It's time to grow up, you know what?",0
I ain't trying to be another bum that's just scared of committin',0
Take everything from these women then go missin',0
I gotta kill the wicked part of my heart that keeps pimpin',0
If I ain't got the strength then I know where to get it,0
You live different when you know you've been forgiven,0
"His love is forever, don't you ever forget it",0
