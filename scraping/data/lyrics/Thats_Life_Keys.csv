"They told me, ""Don't make a promise you can't keep",0
"All the drugs in your system, you can't sleep",0
How many times you had to buy a Plan B,0
"For a girl you never bring back home to meet your family?""",0
"Man, man, I swear it's what I dream about",0
Ever since my mom told me that she need me out,0
"Always smoking weed, 'causing trouble, never clean the house",0
But I paid her back for everything; I guess we even now,0
Nothing better than some head after a long day,0
That's the only thing that ever keep mine on straight,0
"And she asked me, ""Why the long face?""",0
How I spent 350 dollars on this entr√©e,0
I drown my sorrow in that bottle,0
"Today is full of regret, find forever in tomorrow",0
"Man up, what's the problem?",0
Everything is Jazz and I'm Stockton (Haha),1
[Chorus: Mac Miller],0
"Yeah, I know it seem a little bit strange sometimes (Yeah, yeah)",0
"Everybody live a little, everybody die (Yeah, yeah)",0
"That's life (That's life), whatchu gonna do? (Whatchu gonna do?)",0
"That's life (That's life), baby, I would spend it all witchu (",0
All with you,0

"And I'm headed to the other side, where the grass is always greener",0
"And your bitch is down to ride, but that ass is always meaner",0
"See, my cash got deeper and my morals disappeared",0
"Never thought I'd be a asshole, this my last show",0
Can I please get a standing ovation?,0
A hunnid naked bitches in my dressing room waiting,0
We lost a lot of blood for this fucked up nation,0
"But me, I'm getting high, making love in that spaceship",0
So what are the basics? Tell me your problems,0
"You losin' your job or, even worse, you don't got one",0
So hard to stay sober when you feeling fucked over so much,1
"Always coming up short, you like the roach of a blunt (Yeah)",1
And I could never sleep at night,0
"Fuck paying bills, I need a brand new lease on life",0
Why does doing wrong always feel so right?,0
"Well, I guess, fuck it, that's life (That's life)",0
[Chorus: Mac Miller],0
"Yeah, I know it seem a little bit strange sometimes (Yeah, yeah)",0
"Everybody live a little, everybody die (Yeah, yeah)",0
"That's life (That's life), whatchu gonna do? (Whatchu gonna do?)",0

"Now, I wish I could take all your pain",1
But when the toxin is fame,1
"The drugs, they don't fill the hole, no",1
Connections the game,1
Wish you'd picked up the phone,1
Knew that I'd be your home,1
Knew that you weren't alone,1
Knew that you weren't alone,1
Knew that you weren't alone,1

"That's life, and I wish you could have spent it on the truth",1
