[Verse 1],0
Woke up and just felt right,0
Phone blown like a tailpipe,0
Today's schedule airtight,0
I turn a short day into a long night,0
See you soon if you got the heart,0
Meet you outside Rennie park,1
Hurry up if it's gettin' dark,0
We don't say much and that says a lot,0
Hopped into that old Benz,0
Drive through where that road ends,0
Good times with some old friends,0
I got just the thing if you so tense,0
"Burn one, let's go do some",0
She got me stoned as Medusa,1
Zoned out with a blank stare,0
I'm lookin' into the future,0
[Pre-Chorus],0
"Hold up, ain't nothing gonna hold us",0
Put the devil to the side,0
Got an angel on my shoulder,0
And I'm like hello,0
It's good to finally let go,0
I ain't worried 'bout a thing,0
I just like to keep it mello,0
[Chorus],0
Yeah I like to keep it mello,0
I smoke to keep it mello,0
I drink to keep it mello,0
Every day I keep it mello,0
Every day I keep it mello,0
I smoke to keep it mello,0
I drink to keep it mello,0
Every day I keep it mello,0
Every day I keep it mello,0
[Verse 2],0
It's like 4 am and I'm bored again,0
When that 40 end,0
When that dream team all played out and they hit the bench,0
"I just step back, lemme soak it in",0
"I've seen the ups and downs so I get it now, I was born to win",0
"It's my time, 'bout time, my turn, I can't lie",0
Waiting for that one spark,0
My one hope to catch fire,0
"I'm fine, I'm high",0
Light rain through that sunshine,0
Tryin' to man this old boat,0
I'm the captain now and it's crunch time,0
I don't care if I'm gettin' paid,0
Need the week but I get the day,0
Wide awake when I need sleep,0
I'm knee deep but I set the way,0
"Focused on that one mistake, let it free don't let it break",0
"Fuck it all, I'm turning in",0
"My celly's off,",0
the great escape,1
[Pre-Chorus],0
"Hold up, ain't nothing gonna hold us",0
Put the devil to the side,0
Got an angel on my shoulder,0
And I'm like hello,0
It's good to finally let go,0
I ain't worried 'bout a thing,0
I just like to keep it mellow,0
[Chorus],0
Yeah I like to keep it mello,0
I smoke to keep it mello,0
I drink to keep it mello,0
Every day I keep it mello,0
Every day I keep it mello,0
I smoke to keep it mello,0
I drink to keep it mello,0
Every day I keep it mello,0
Every day I keep it mello,0
[Chorus],0
Yeah I like to keep it mello,0
I smoke to keep it mello,0
I drink to keep it mello,0
Every day I keep it mello,0
Every day I keep it mello,0
I smoke to keep it mello,0
I drink to keep it mello,0
Every day I keep it mello,0
Every day I keep it mello,0
[Outro],0
I smoke to keep it mello,0
I drink to keep it mello,0
Every day I keep it mello,0
Every day I keep it mello,0
