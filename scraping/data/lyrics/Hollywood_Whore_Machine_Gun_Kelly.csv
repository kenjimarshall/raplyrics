[Verse 1],0
Am I wrong for being lost?,0
The pressures of being boss exhausted every bone in my body,0
I can't walk,0
"I don’t talk, I scream, I don't stop to think",0
I'm so close to the dream that I can’t go to sleep,0
"Ironic, I know, so I need more chronic to roll",0
"Tryna find what's more important, the money or my soul",0
"It's cold, I'm low, I'm caught between the roads",0
"Under the Hollywood sign, you get blinded by the glow, uh",0
"Yo, how could you look me in the face?",0
You sat at the table with my daughter promising you got us,1
Right after you finished saying grace,1
Why don't you tell her what you're hiding in the bank?,1
It's time to cut my lawn to see the snakes,1
It’s time to tell the truth to every fan who doesn’t understand,0
That it's because of you they had to wait,0
While you left me here to deal with all the hate,0
"I still smile, but feel so fake",1
"It’s no sun, the clouds are opaque",0
So much shade I read on one page,0
I can't even look at your name without getting the shakes,0
"What a mistake, uh, look how you take, uh",0
"What doesn't belong to you, this was a rape",0
And if fate send us both to Heaven,0
"I'ma keep a blade in my leather so I can kill you at the gate, uh",0

(First place),1
Is it worth it when you see it’s all (Two-faced)?,1
Trying to fit into a world with no (New space),1
Commit third-degree murder (What for?),1
Tryna play me like a Hollywood whore,0
(First place),1
Is it worth it when you see it's all (Two-faced)?,1
Trying to fit into a world with no (New space),1
Commit third-degree murder (What for?),1
Tryna play me like a Hollywood whore,0
[Verse 2],0
"I woke up sweatin', tryna forget I'm in a mansion",1
'Cause fans are mad at my expansion,1
And my friend I thought was family,1
Who'd always understand me,1
Got offended 'cause he jealous,1
We supposed to be at the GRAMMYs,1
"I'm asking, when did pride and passion",0
Get mistaken for handouts and ass-kissing?,0
The fact is I made it from trailer trash to Saks 5th,0
"Took it from underground to massive, and the come up was classic",0
"Back when white boys rapped, they gettin' their ass kicked",0
"I was battlin', putting these rappers in caskets",0
"I was walking home, getting jumped after classes",0
Tell me why don't my haters mention that shit?,0
Now my rent is due and I'm a tenant getting by with no credit,0
Got residue from a sedative I ain't get from the medic,0
"My schedule is so fuckin' hectic, but still I'm in debt",0
I'd be better off dead so life insurance keep my family fed,0
"It's because of y'all, I couldn't separate from my career",0
"Because of y'all, I hated myself for so many years",0
"Because of you, you ain't never gonna see me trust",0
"Even if I got a wife, she just somebody I fuck",0
[Chorus],0
(First place),1
Is it worth it when you see it's all (Two-faced)?,1
Trying to fit into a world with no (New space),1
Commit third-degree murder (What for?),1
Tryna play me like a Hollywood whore,0
(First place),1

Tryna play me like a Hollywood whore,0
