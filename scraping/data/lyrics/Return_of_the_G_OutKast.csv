[Intro: André 3000],0
"Yeah, yeah it goes like this right here",1
"Like uh, niggas always be hollering ""peace""",1
"You know what I'm saying, ""peace my brother""",1
"Peace this, peace that, you know what I'm saying but",1
Every time I uh try to get a peace of mind,1
Niggas try to get a piece of mine,1
So I gotta grab my piece,1
[Verse 1: André 3000],1
"It's the return of the gangster, thanks ta'",1
Them niggas that's on that blow that run up in your crib,1
Which contains your lady and an 8 month old,1
Child to raise plus you true blue 'bout this music but,1
They do not want to hear it,1
Because they'd rather be bouncing and shooting,1
And killing and bouncing and shit,1
",",0
get down,1
"Return of the gangsta, thanks ta'",1
Them niggas that think you soft and say y'all be gospel rappin',1
But they be steady clappin' when you talk about,1
"Bitches, and switches, and hoes, and clothes, and weed",1
"Let's talk about time travelin', rhyme javelin",1
"Somethin' mind unravelin', get down",1
Return of the gangsta thanks ta',1
Them niggas that got them kids,1
That got enough to buy an ounce,1
But not enough to bounce them kids to the zoo,1
Or to the park so they grow up in the dark never,1
Seein' light 'til they end up being like yo' sorry ass,1
Robbin' niggas in broad-ass daylight get down,1
Return of the gangsta thanks ta',1
Them niggas who get the wrong impression of expression,1
Then the question is Big Boi what's up with Andre?,1
Is he in a cult? Is he on drugs? Is he gay?,1
When y'all gon' break up? When y'all gon' wake up?,1
Nigga I'm feelin' better than ever what's wrong with you,1
You get down!,1
[Chorus],0
"Gangsta (it's the return, it's the return–turn–turn–turn)",1
"Ooh (It's the return–turn, it's the return–turn, it's the return, return)",1
"Gangsta (It's the return–turn, it's the return–turn)",1
"Ooh (It's the return, it's the return–turn–turn)",1
[Verse 2: Big Boi],0
"Man, a nigga don't want no trouble",1
A playa just want to kick back with my gators off,1
And watch my lil' girl blow bubbles,1
"But still ready to rhyme, standing my ground never back down",1
Willin' to rob steal and kill any thang that threatens mine,1
"But good luck couldn't be bought, see",0
"Many a fights had to be fought, G",1
For a nigga to ride these Vogues,1
Oh so close to the sidewalk to be gawked at,1
Watch your side my nigga cause we got gats,0
The first nigga to buck is gon' be the first nigga we attack,0
"Don't want that, but it comes though, most of the time when you don't know",0
Stickin' together like flour and water to make that slow dough,1
We worked for everything we have and gon' stick up for,1
"Each other, like we brothers from another mother",1
Kind of like Mel Gibson and Danny Glover,1
Strictly for the Caddy lovers,0
And never the nut huggin' punk motherfuckers,0
So quit spreading them rumors,1
We ain't Club Nouveau,1
[Chorus],0
"Gangsta (it's the return, it's the return–turn–turn–turn)",1
"Ooh (It's the return–turn, it's the return–turn, it's the return, return)",1
"Gangsta (It's the return–turn, it's the return–turn)",1
"Ooh (It's the return, it's the return–turn–turn)",1
[Skit],1
