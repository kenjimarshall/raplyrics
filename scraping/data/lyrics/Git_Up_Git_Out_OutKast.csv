"Nigga, you need to git up, git out and git something",1
Don't let the days of your life pass by,1
"You need to git up, git out and git something",1
Don't spend all your time tryna get high,1

"I don't recall, ever graduating at all",1
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all,1
Every day I just lay around then I can't be found,1
"Always asking ""Gimme some,"" living life like a bum",1
"Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own",1
"Nigga, you supposed to be grown",1
"I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be",1
But negativity is all you seem to ever see,1
"I admit, I've done some dumb shit, and I'm probably gon' do some mo'",1
You shouldn't hold that against me though,1
(Why not?) Why not? My music's all that I got,1
But some time must be invested for this to be manifested,1
"I know you know but I'm gon' say this to you, I",1
Get high but I don't get too high,1
So what's the limit 'posed to be?,1
That must be why you can't get yo ass up out the bed before three,1
"You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out",1
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without?,0
"Damn, what up with all these questions?",0
"You act as though you know something I don't, do you have any suggestions?",0
Cause every job I get is cruel and demeaning,1
Sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning,1
But I'm also sick and tired of struggling,1
I never ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smuggling,1
"Naw, that ain't what I'm about",1
Cee-Lo will just continue traveling his route,1
Without any doubt or fear,1
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here,1
Did I make myself clear?,1

"So in a sense, I was Rosemary's baby",1
And then I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady,1
"Hell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see I pimped 'em",1
Bitch never had my money so I never whipped 'em,0
See all the playas came and all the playas went,0
"A playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit, bitch",1
"You need to git up, git out, git something",0
"Smoke out cause it's all about money, money, money",0
"Yeah I said it, a nigga sporting plaits and a Braves hat",1

And all that other fat shit like that, ha-ha!",0

Out the Point to Campbellton Road,1
The valley of the Southside flow,0

Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit,1
Cause they known for jumping out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog,1
"Here come the Red Dogs, I'm busting out around the corner in my hog",1
"Dipping from the area, I'm scared",0
"So one of these bitches might wind up dead, cause I have no time for jail",0
"Fuck Clampett cops, fuck Elgin Bell",1

"Instead of being in class, I'd rather be up in some ass",1
Not thinking about them six courses that I need to pass,1
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies,0
"Damn, that's fucked up, I should've listened when my mama told me",1
