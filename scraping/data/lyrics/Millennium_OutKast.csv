Me and everything around me is unstable like Chernobyl,1
"Ready to go at any moment, jumping like a pogo stick",1
"Life never lived up to my expectations, so I accept the patience",1
Expect the worse but now I'm pacing,1

A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences,1
"I had the best of life in my clenches, but monkey wrenches was thrown",1
Like chairs kings sit on,1

my prayers seem too long,1
"I fall asleep before the ending, don't even get to say Amen",1
I hope He understand I be on bended knees,1
"At times, I think I'm crazy, then I say 'forget it'",1
Or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and,1
like Riddick...Bowe,1
I've been fighting this since them fetus days,1
"I count from one to twenty, when I'm through, repeat the phrase",1
"It's just a phase, it's gon' all pass, but that gets old too",1
I'm weakening like a deacon doing dirt,1
What am I s'posed do?,1
