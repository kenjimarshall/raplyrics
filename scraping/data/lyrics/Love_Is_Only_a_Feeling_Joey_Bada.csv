"Look, I love her curves but what's more preferred",1
Is the way she articulates words,1
Can't help observe and stare,1
When she in the mirror,1
Masking the massacre while she fixing her hair,1
I mean sheâ€™s so perfect,0
In her own little world,0
"We built the foundation, everything I want in a girl",0
And it's a matter of time until her last name mine,0
"You got potential baby, just imagine us combined",0
I wanna see you shine like the gem that you are,0
Want you be so secure that they can see from afar,0
That you don't need not a man,0
And you can stand on your own,0
Let's keep stacking your bread,0
And one day we gonna get gone,0
And get away from here,0
You're the only reason I be staying here,0
"Wanna paint a picture, let's make it clear",0
"The future so bright baby, race you there, girl",0

Love is only a feeling,1
Love is only a feeling,1
Love is only a feeling,1
Love is only a feeling,1

"Look, girl you talk too much, need to relax",0
"No stress please, just please roll us a fat",0
Blunt so we can smoke and fill the room with love,0
You buzz 'cause I'm feelin' the groove with this one,0
"Come take you a sip, let's dance under the moon",0
"They way that it's lit, got me feelin' the mood",0
"To vibe and be tuned, I'm so into you",0
Let's lose track of the night and stay up til it's noon,0
Watch the sun rise and watch the moon fall,0
"Asleep if you will, surprise when you spawn",0
Back from the world of infinite beyond,0
Roll your eyes back and let's keep on goin',0
"Come take a ride, I'll be your chauffeur",0
I wanna make you sing to me as your toes curl,1
I love it when she doing all the things I showed her,0
"I thank the Lord for her, man, I swear I owe her",0

Love is only a feeling,1
Love is only a feeling,1
Love is only a feeling,1
Love is only a feeling,1
