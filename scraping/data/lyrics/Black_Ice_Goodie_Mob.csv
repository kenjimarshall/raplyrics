Do you ever see that stuff that be,1
When it get cold that ice that you can't see?,1
See that shit happens sometimes,1
"Yep, black ice",1
[Verse 1: Gipp],0
Now you know and I know,0
"I done bumped every hole in the wall, y'all",1
Did you catch that phone call?,0
Most of y'all that met me thought I was tall,0
"Gipp flipped like a dip, slipped, fell on the black ice",1
Did you think twice? Homeslice came and he went,0
"Satisfied, got bent, bars ain't shit",0
"Meetin' coast to coast, yeah, I laughed and boast",1
"Man do-si-dos, too many comin' close to",1
[Hook],0
"Touch what I never touched befo', seen what I never seen befo'",0
"Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high",0
[Verse 2],0
Circulate like a Sunday paper,1
"Capers caught long time, to cheap flicks, good picks",0
"Paid hard, watch the hard turn sideways",0
Pick the tale for real sales to those who lose cash,0
Players keep your life for now,0
"Feeling good and warm, windows rolled tight",0
"Thirty-five degrees, nippy tonight",1
"Don't forget the ChapStick, lips dry quick",1
When the jack out,1
", make you wanna act out",0
Take the slack out,1
", some people black out",0
Hibernatin' 'til we came back out,1
[Hook],0
"Touch what I never touched befo', seen what I never seen befo'",0
"Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high (Sky high)",0
"Touch what I never touched befo', seen what I never seen befo'",0
"Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high",0
[Verse 3],0
I been in it for the past few days,0
"Tighter than fades, I'm knowin' my plays",1
Now can I rap? Can I adapt? Not really sure yet,0
Who that lookin' over the shoulders of those writin' dreams?,0
Fiendin' for the taste of menthol,0
"Missed class, stayed in the hall",0
Lookin' for a squeeze play,1
", better yet a holiday",0
Stayed away from the pyramid board game,0
Broke it down to a neighborhood slang,0
Cash before fame,0
Sky high (Repeat 10X),0
[Verse 4: Big Boi],0
Now who done stepped in?,0
"The nigga the B-I-G, the secret weapon, Boi",0
"Slicker than Black Ice, throwin' these flows like rice at weddings",0
"So quit flexing, we speakin' about",1
Somethin' that's refreshing to the earlobes,1
Pay for the room and still be in pimp mode,1
Like Iceberg,1
", Chryslers and Buicks",0
Some niggas ain't on they jobs so them suckers here to lose it,0
Abuse they privileges and now the whole villages been shot to pieces,0
"'Cause niggas are biting that same stupid shit, I mean that feces",1
"Boy, don't beep me, if you ain't got no work",1

"Every time I heard you rhymin' like a fucking jerk, boy; simp",0
Yeah!,0
[Verse 5: Andre Benjamin],0
"Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your eardrums",1
It was a beautiful day off in the neighborhood,1
Yellows and greens and blues and browns,1
And greys and hues that ooze beneath dilapidated wood,1
Ain't a thing could explain what pertains,0
To cocaine and sustaining reign,0
"See summer rolls around, niggas holla bout change",1
Then they steady move them ki's like Bob James,1
"'Cause old man winter's arrived, the temperature dives",0
"November just died, December's alive",0
Thus it ain't no typical ride,0
Just individual's way to bring home,1
The bacon when bacon was all gone,1
"Makin' it our own, takin' me all wrong",0
We've all indulged in the bulge of those no-no's,1
"No, you ain't solo, there's even lower levels you can go",1
"Take sun people, put 'em in a land of snow",1
[Hook],0
"Touch what I never touched befo', seen what I never seen befo'",0
"Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high",0
