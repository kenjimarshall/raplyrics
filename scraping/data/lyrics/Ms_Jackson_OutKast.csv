My baby drama mama don't like me,0
"She be doin' things like havin' them boys come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me",0
She need to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out,1
"That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out",1
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check,1
"Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that",1
I love your mom and everything,1
"But see, I ain't the only one who laid down",1
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war,1
My lawyers stay down,1
"Shit, you never got a chance to hear my side of the story",1
We was divided,1
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday,1
"I ain't invited,",1
despite it,0
I show her the utmost respect when I fall through,0
"All you do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah",1

Me and your daughter got a special thing goin' on,1
"You say it's puppy love, we say it's full-grown",1
"Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever",1
You can plan a pretty picnic,1
"But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson",1
[Verse 2: André 3000],0
"Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find",1
"The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline",1
"King meets queen, then the puppy love thing",1
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing,1
"On the oak tree,",1
I hope we feel like this forever,1
"Forever, forever ever? Forever ever?",1
Forever never seems that long until you're grown,1
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong,1
"Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could",1
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder,1
"Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he",1
Askin' what happened to the feelin' that her and me had,1
"I pray so much about it, need some knee pads",1
"It happened for a reason, one can't be mad",1
"So know this, know that everything's cool",1
"And yes, I will be present on the first day of school",1
And graduation,1

"""Look at the way he treats me""",1
"Shit, look at the way you treat me",1
"You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls",1
"Done got your ass sent up the creek, G",1
"Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out",1
And I knew you and your girl ain't speakin' no more,1
‘Cause my dick all in her mouth,1
Know what I'm talkin' about?,1
"Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating",1
"In the year two to the G, they be the same thing",1
So who you placin' the blame on?,1
You keep on singin' the same song,1
"Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on",1
You and your mama,1
