[Verse 1],0
You don't know how little you matter until you're all alone,1
In the middle of Arkansas with a little rock left in that glass dick,1
"Used to date a blonde, you used to hit it raw",1
"Cause she was and you are madly involved, madly involved",1
[Hook],0
Hittin' stones in glass homes,1
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes,1
You hit them stones and broke your home,1
"Crack rock, crack rock",1
"Crack rock, crack rock",1
Hittin' stones in glass homes,1
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes,1
You hit them stones and broke your home,1
"Crack rock, crack rock",1
"Crack rock, crack rock",1
[Verse 2],0
"You're shuckin' and jivin', stealin' and robbin'",1
To get the fixing that you're itching for,1
Your family stopped inviting you to things,1
Won't let you hold their infant,1
You used to to get a little cut-up from time to time,1
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky,1

"Crooked cop, dead cop",1
How much dope can you push to me?,1
"Crooked cop, dead cop",1
No good for community,1
"Fuckin' pig get shot, three hundred men will search for me",1
My brother get popped and don't no one hear the sound,1
Don't no one hear the rounds (Sound),1
Don't no one hear the shells (Shells),1
[Outro],0
Don't no one hear a sound,1
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot,1
Don't no one disrupt nirvana,1
Don't no one wanna blow the high,1
"Crack rock, crack rock, crack rock",1
How you feeling girl?,1
How's the gutter doing?,1
Crack rock,1
