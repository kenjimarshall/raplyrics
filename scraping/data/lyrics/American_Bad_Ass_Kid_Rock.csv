[Intro],0
Yeah! and I've set up and torn down this stage with my own two hands,1
We've traveled this land packed tight in minivans,1
"And all this for the fans, girls, money, and fame",0
"I play their game, and then they scream my name",0
"I will show no shame, I live and die for this",0
"If I come off soft, then chew on this....",0
Are you scared?,0

Devil without cause,1
", and I'm back",0
With the beaver hats,0
and Ben Davis slacks,1
30-pack of Stroh's,1
", 30-pack of hoes",0
No rogaine in the propane flows,0
"Chosen one, I'm the living proof",0
With the gift of gab from the city of truth,0
I jabbed and stabbed and knocked critics back,1
And I did not stutter when I said that,1
I'm goin platinum sellin' rhymes,1
I went platinum seven times,1
And still they ill they wanna see us fry,0
I guess because of only God knows why,0
Why why why why,0

I'm the singer in black,1
"Throw a finger in the air, let me see where you're at",0
"And say ""Hey, hey""",0
"Let me hear where you're at and say ""Hey, hey""",0
"I'm giving it back so say ""Hey, hey""",0
