[Intro],0
Yo,0
Bugzy Malone,0
You know,0
[Verse 1],0
I hit the top like I don't know what,0
Now 500's Play-Doh gwop,1
And these man tryna take my spot when I'm sitting at home with writer's block,0
But there's not an MC as eloquent as me,0
Let me get that clear,0
"And my accountant said, I can make a million and not make a track this year",1
Now how's that for a turnover?,1
I made a gilet and a holster,1
Felt like I looked in the mirror when I seen the new JD poster,1
And it sold out so fast,1
",",0
they want me to sign contracts like they're O2 or Voda,1
In exchange for exposure,0
"But still, I don't feel any closer to the real answer",0
Why did I wanna be a gangster?,0
When will I get rid of this pain?,1
Feels like I'm in handcuffs,1
I wanna fly to the south of France,0
I wanna learn how to Salsa dance,0
The chef come here,0
'Cause everybody in the restaurant kept watching man,0
"And I'm thinking ""Wait are they watching man?""",0
"Do they think I'm a prick, or are they just secret fans?",0
"Blessed by a God, fear no man",0
But my heart still beats when I see a police van,0
I was hungover,0
In Phuket I couldn't stay sober,0
"I needed a break from pulling a straight face, I don't play poker",0
I was out there looking at the pelicans,0
Stroking the tigers and elephants,0
MC's all fighting for relevance,0
But I'm on the next level of eloquence,0
Where do I get it from?,0
Did I get it from him?,0
"Could it be a white, could it be a black thing?",0
Must be the reason I'm the captain,0
Must be the reason I overlapped him,0
'Cause I'm dedicated,0
"Me, I could have got relegated",0
Imagine I would have hesitated,0
Where would I be if I never made it?,0
But I did,0
"Now I'm in a new 7 bedroom crib with spotlights in the ceiling, it's sick",1
"No bean bag, I've got a Lamborghini on the ramp and I don't use it",1
I've got a grand piano in front of the Mona and everything cocaine white,1
But I don't get to see it much these days 'cause I'm always out taking a flight,1
Thinking about before it all went bad,1
Never got dissed off my real dad,1
Now he tells people that I never give him anything,1
As if he was there from scratch,1
How did it get so negative,0
Between old friends and fake relatives?,0
"I've come quite far, when I reminisce",0
To get rid of these toxic energies,0
An old friend tells people that I put money on his head,0
As if I'm still pissed off,0
And we was friends from about year 9,0
And he tried to get my door kicked off,0
"Cocaine's one hell of a drug, yeah, I've seen what it does",0
I watched man fall from the mountains,0
Turned from a bad boy to a scroff,0
I'm still out here holding it up,0
I'm still backstage holding a cup,0
Darkee's still my co-defendant,1
I'm in a film about money and drugs,1
"I told my agent, ""Tell Guy Ritchie he don't need to pay me""",1
"As I was watching Snatch, that's my all time favourite gangster movie",1
"I ended up in the GR, singing Irish songs to the ukulele",0
"Sophisticated conversation, had me feeling so creative (So creative)",0
[Verse 2],0
"I feel detached from reality, now I'm on a footballer's salary",1
"I flew to Rome, and the roof of the Sistine chapel look like an art gallery",0
"Me, I got close to insanity",0
"On the roadside, moving raggity",0
"Now I'm in the Vatican, thinking strategy",0
Can't think of an MC in my category,0
All this from a 1-bedroom flat,0
I wanted a reminder not to look back,0
"That's the reason why, I got 'King of the North' tattooed right across my six-pack",1
"And the artist came from Italia, the home of the mafia",1
"I'm never in debt, I'm a Lannister, they know I'm of a different calibre",1
I climbed to the top without a banister,0
"And last year, got smashed, no manager",0
Man can say what they want but I'll never let anyone assassinate my character,0
Some relationships don't work,0
And the separation hurts,0
I know these are simple words but I always told her I loved her first,0
I used to be so immature,0
Even though the love was pure,0
I was never always all yours,0
Some of them nights on tour,0
You could've walked out through the open door,0
When the love turned into a war,0
"And now I'm gonna buy you a house, just so you know you're secure (Sometimes I don't know, no no no)",0
"Let me get it off my chest (Sometimes I don't know, no no no)",1
"Turns out how no matter how much money I make I still can't pay to correct (Sometimes I don't know, no no no)",1
"All of the trauma, it still feels fresh, but never again will that get me depressed",0
Don't mind going out as a legend as long as I'm known as Manchester's best,1
[Outro],0
"Sometimes I don't know, no no no",0
"Sometimes I don't know, no no no",0
Sometimes I don't kno- oh oh oh,0
"Sometimes I don't know, no no no",0
"Sometimes I don't know, no no no",0
Sometimes I don't kno- oh oh oh,0
Sometimes I don't know,0
