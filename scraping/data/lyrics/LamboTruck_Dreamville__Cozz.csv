[Chorus: Childish Major],0
"Ayy, what's those? You want these",0
You gotta have fees plus more,0
So much heat you can't hold,0
"A lot of green, kind that can't fold",0
What's those? You want these,0
You gotta have fees plus more,0
So much heat you can't hold,0
"Whole lot of green, kind that can't fold",0
[Verse 1: Cozz],0
Oh yeah,0
Lookin' great but feeling bummy,0
"I just ate, but still I'm hungry",0
"I got something, but I ain't nothing",0
Brother tummy isn't chubby,0
"Bills like nymphos, they keep coming",0
"Always something, something, something",0
Copped some things but I ain't fed,0
"Dreams alive, my wallet dead",0
Pockets been bleeding,0
I got a reason to commit treason,0
But I'ma hit REASON and see what he think,1
About how he been treated at TDE,1
'Cause I done been scheming,1
"Schoolboy just dropped, give me the cue",1
I'm desperate enough to go do what it do,1
SZA done popped and y'all got Dot,1
I heard Jay Rock has been moving them units,1
"Soul and Isaiah Rashad, boy, you niggas really up at the top",1
Almost thought about popping a Glock,0
But a nigga ain't stupid and I ain't a shooter,0
But who really is until they provoked?,0
"Nigga, this hunger got me finna choke",0
Starting to think that this isn't a joke,0
"Gave up the liquor, I'm bringing the smoke",0
"I talked to Bas, we fiending for more",1
A nigga done tried speaking to Cole,1
He be too busy but he be the bro,1
"Shit, fuck it, I know how it go",1
So if I can't get a response from my label,1
And get some more food on my table,1
We can turn this thing into a fable,1
And take what I can if I'm able,1

Gotta have fees plus more,0
So much heat you can't hold,0
"Whole lot of green, kind that can't fold",0
[Verse 2: REASON],0

"I been on the same shit, getting brain, I'm such a wise guy",0
"Niggas took shots, plenty, South Park, Kenny, I don't die die",1
"I'm not just gonna slide on you, my nigga, we gon' slide slide",0
"Made a living staying posted like I'm Diesel, this no sequel",1

Cole just pulled up in a Lamborghini truck,0
"On the homies and God, we should rob that nigga",0

Cozz,0
& REASON],0
Rob that nigga?,0
"Yeah, rob that nigga",0
"Look, Rob, my nigga
You could try, but Cole ain't a thot, my nigga",0
"Wait Cozz, I ain't sayin' he a thot, my nigga",0
"Look, let me explain",0
We could tie Ib up,0
Throw him in the back of a Lamborghin' truck,0
"Cole do something, we could let a Glock squeeze up",0
"Wait chill, ease up
I ain't really trying to get involved, my nigga, look

Picture me having what they told me I should have,0
"I've been living off some scraps, I done sold a couple packs",0
"I been smoking potent, sippin' slow, fuck you think I'm in it for?",0
I'm just tryna make a bag,0
