"White shirt now red, my bloody nose",1
"Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes",0
Creepin' around like no one knows,0
Think you're so criminal,0
Bruises on both my knees for you,1
Don't say thank you or please,0
I do what I want when I'm wanting to,0
My soul? So cynical,0
[Chorus],0
So you're a tough guy,1
Like it really rough guy,1
Just can't get enough guy,1
Chest always so puffed guy,1
I'm that bad type,1
Make your mama sad type,1
Make your girlfriend mad tight,1
Might seduce your dad type,1
I'm the bad guy,1
Duh,1

I'm the bad guy,1
[Verse 2],0
I like it when you take control,0
Even if you know that you don't,0
"Own me, I'll let you play the role",0
I'll be your animal,0
My mommy likes to sing along with me,0
But she won't sing this song,0
If she reads all the lyrics,0
She'll pity the men I know,0
[Chorus],0
So you're a tough guy,1
Like it really rough guy,1
Just can't get enough guy,1

I'm that bad type,1
Make your mama sad type,1
Make your girlfriend mad tight,1
Might seduce your dad type,1
I'm the bad guy,1
Duh,1

[Bridge],0
I like when you get mad,0
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone,0
You said she's scared of me?,0
"I mean, I don't see what she sees",0
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne,0
[Outro],0
I'm a bad guy,1
I'm a bad guy,1
"Bad guy, bad guy",1
I'm a bad,1
