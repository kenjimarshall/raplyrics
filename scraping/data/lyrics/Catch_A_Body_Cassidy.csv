"Look, fuck Meek Mill, Dreamchasers, MMG",0

[Chorus],0
"Yeah, I'm about to body y'all",0
"Yea, I'm about to body y'all",0
"Catch a body with bars, watch the body fall",0

"Yeah, I'm about to body y'all",0
"Yea, I'm about to body y'all",0
"Catch a body with bars, watch the body fall",0
"Then drop the body off, I'm about to body y'all",0
[Verse 1: Cassidy],0
"My tongue like a gun, it's time to let a slugs spray",1
"I been made RAID, but I ain't running out of bug spray",1
"He been a faggot, that nigga always was gay",0
"See he a man bitch, twerking on a man dick",0
"Y'all, he grab balls, no damn mitt",0
"But y'all ain't catch it, I'm infected, I'm too damn sick",0
They gon' have this diss bumping like a damn zit,0
Cause this like tryna make a poodle fight a damn pit,0
"This a dog fight, but every pussy make a dog bite",0
"I'm like high beams, you a fog light",0
"You can't shine, cause your rhymes just alright",0
"I'mma off niggas, soft niggas live a hard life",0
And I don't never have an off night,0
"I'm always on my J-O, this a second round K-O",1
I heard your diss but that shit weak,1
"And you switch beats, that's the same shit I did on RAID yo",1
This nigga soft like Play-Doh,0
"I spit fuego, my dudes is moving if I say so",0
They stay with toasters like an Eggo,0
"Them dudes sick, they a stick a pool stick in your A-hole",0
"Ayo, I been had killers on the payroll",0
When you was still playing with a Lego,0
I never wore fake Air Force 1's,0
I'm in the studio in Gucci's and Air Force guns,0
"You ain't nothing like us, I'm the nicest",0
I was jumping in cyphers while you was in diapers,0
So don't disrespect a grown man,0
"Cause I'll cut your arm off, and then smack you with your own hand",0
Man you said I shoulda died in that car crash,1
Well I'mma soak you in car gas and light a match,0
You should stop writing raps cause your bars trash,0
"I'll have your fraud ass, look like cigar ash",0
"Dag, all burnt the fuck up",0
You shoulda been learnt that I was turnt the fuck up,0
"You said I wear purple Dickies, with du-rag and a 5X tee",0
But you dress like a true fag,0
"Tight ass shirts, squeezing your man breasts",0
"Tight ass pants, looking like Spandex",0
"You better stop it, or you get popped like a Xanax",1
"I'm still feeling myself, no hand sex",0
"Yeah, I wasn't there when the cops came",1
"But how you know, you wasn't there when the shots bang",1
Them cats ratted on me when the cops came,1
"I'm a fucking G, I'll show you my discovery",1
"For real, I ain't take a deal on my man",1
"I took it to trial, and they squealed on my man",1
"Your career going downhill, I feel for you man",0
"I been having skills man, chill, you a fan",0
"I'm still ill man, and you still a fuck corny",0
I think this nigga Meek Millz got a crush on me,0
"I'm doing me, I ain't worrying 'bout your monkey ass",0
It look like this nigga wearing a monkey mask,0
"You trash, don't get gassed with your funky ass",0
"You last like a year or two, but your career through",0
"You terrible, why the fuck would I be scared of you",0
What the hell you telling Cass what your yelling ass,0
My record five thousand and zero,0
"I ain't ever lost, I'mma boss, you's a weirdo",0
You try to act like you a street nigga,0
"But you weak nigga, you ain't Mike Knox or Black Dinero",1
There a lot of Philly niggas that be extra ill,1
But you just a silly niggas with a record deal,0
And you a ugly nigga tryna' have sex appeal,0
You a Ryder yeaaaa? Get the fuck outta here,0
I'm put you on the entrée,0
It's fucked up what you did to that nigga Lil and Conway,1
They was the same cats that came up with you,1
"But you ain't break bread, so they ain't fuck with you",1
You be rhymin' all the time like you bust pistols,0
But nigga you ain't got the heart to do it,0
"Stop talking stupid, I ride out, you need starter fluid",0
"I'm tryna keep the game alive, but it's hard to do it",0
Cause all these artists make garbage music,0
That's why I only listen to myself and my artist music,0
"We got the hardest music, you so soft in your pillow bag",0
I go hard like a Brillo pad,0
"You Mom said I was your Dad, I should be feeling bad",0
"Cause I missed your whole childhood, and that's really sad",0
She really mad that I don't deal with your silly ass,0
"I did pop ya Mom, but you was not mine",1
"Naw, I'm 'bout to call Maury on the hot line",1
"And get a DNA, cause you know what he'a say",1
"(You are not) the father, damn right",1
These chicks you be screwing could ruin your damn life,0
I got a whole lot of Sons,0
But the only biological ones is with my damn wife,0
"Life is a gamble, so you better roll the damn dice",0
The right type of way or you gotta price to pay,0
"Aye, I stay wire, you already know",0
Higher than a helium balloon when you let it go,1
"I drink a whole cup liquor, twist a whole dutch",0
"Of that grape haze, I call it a Fruit Roll Up",0
"You know what, I'm too damn good",0
So I'mma blow up like tryna microwave a canned good,0
"Ya man good, I spray mine",0
"Since a kid, I was like Trayvon, walking in the damn hood",1
Now I spit new bars over old beats,0
"My flow heat, I got a hot head not cold feet",0
"I roll leaf, get higher than the bloody nose seats",1
"You so sweet, from Monday to Sunday you so weak",0
"I'm so street, I know you don't want no beef",0
"Cause when I put the caps in your grill, it ain't gold teeth",0
"I throw bullets like a QB, go deep",0
"Cause when I blast rounds, it'll be your last down",0
"(Pratt, prattt, pratt), be the last sound",0
"That you ever hear, blood will be squirting everywhere",0
"You dead, your head'll look like it was never there",0
"Yeah, I'll that tough talking'll get you a shut coffin",0
"Yup, me and your main slut fuck often",0
"I pick her up, and get my dick sucked, fuck talking",0
"And I stopped wearing jewels, I don't wanna shine",0
Cause even in the Summer time it be the fuck hawking,0
"I'm still balling, 40 points, 10 assists",0
"I've been the shit, you ain't about that life, you ain't into this",0
"Sit the bench, you can't ball on the injured list",0
I'll end you career for free to be generous,0
"I'm not a feminist, I get more chicks than Ellen Degeneres",0
But this dick from with benefits,0
"You been a bitch, nobody think you a thug",0
Cause you a made plenty scenes in 'em skinny jeans,0
I'll make you skinny dip in a pool of blood,0
"When this Ruger slug, blow your ass to smithereens",0
"And you said you fucked my girl, that's bullshit",1
But me and my wife had a ménage with your bitch,1
"The Bul hit, and then I came on the whore lips",0
"Then sent her home, and you was kissing the whore lip",0
"Let's get shit straight, I had my dick in that bitch face",0
So you should let him know how my dick taste,0
Them corny bars you done set already,1
You already know I heard it on the radio in February,1
You had to wait 8 months to respond back,1
"Nigga you ain't ready for combat, your rhymes wack",0
"Yea, I'm prolly on the molly and some Cognac",0
"But I'mma make Rick Ross, rip up your contract",0
"I'm too real, you ain't never had true skill",0
"I ain't broke chill, man I'm still worth a few mill",0
You remind me of Sisqó from Dru Hill,0
"Fuck how you feel, you got Lil Snupe killed",0
And you only ride out on two wheels,0
"You a motorcycle nigga, I don't like you nigga",0
"I spit cooked crack, I put that on the Bible nigga",0
"I pack guns, to jack son like Michael nigga",0
And all your bars is recycled nigga,0
"I got a bunch rhymes, you say the same shit a bunch of times",0
"And I know Rick Ross, the real Rick Ross",1
"Shit your boss stole his name, got him pissed off",1
Cause he was really in the street knocking bricks off,1
"Kilo after kilo, and yours was a C.O",1
The last time we ran into each other,0
"You was like, ""Cass let's do a song, you know you tha Hustla""",0
"Yeah, I run my city like Broad Street",0
"Do you really wanna take it there, is you sure Meek",0
"The next time, I'mma slaughter one of your beats",0
"The streets gon' be like, ""Cass spazzed on the bul Meek""",0
"Yeah, I keep rapping 'til the track stop",0
"I spit crack rock, Meek don't act shocked",0
"I'mma a legend, you know what I did already",0
"Everybody know I bodied you, and your crib already",0
I bodied you on every song that we ever made,0
Then I bodied you again when I put together RAID,0
"This fight right here, is an easy win",0
"Everybody 'bout to Tweet, ""Cass bodied Meek again""",0
I know I'm getting underneath your skin,0
"He prolly in his Phantom, having a temper tantrum",1
I'mma always have the fucking belt,0
"I'mma body you, so you can ghost write for your fucking self",0
I don't wanna hear nothing else,0
"Yo, just go cut your dick off and go fuck your self",0
