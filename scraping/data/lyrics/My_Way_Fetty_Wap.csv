Ba-Ba-Baby,1
This is something you should know,1
I don't ever chase no hoes,1
"I spotted you, you had that glow",1
Watch me pull out all this dough,1
Take you where you want to go,1
"Flexin' on your ex, I know",1
He ain't ever take you out,1
Barely even left your house,1
How dare that nigga run his mouth,1
When his pockets in a drought?,1
The last single he put out,1
Didn't even make it out,1
"And he dumb as hell and I swear his ass don't think, ayy",1
"If he disrespect, two shots and I won't blink, ayy",1
"Never really cared what the fuck these niggas think, ayy",1
"I got deep pockets, I swear my shit's on sink, ayy",1
"And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap all she sing, ayy",1
"And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap in her dreams, ayy",1
"Well, he mad as fuck, when they sex she scream for me, ayy",1
"Big ZooWap what these niggas should be, ayy",1

"Oh, baby girl, you can stay the night 'til the morn'",1
"All this ice on my arm, what you like, what you want?",1
"And I might put you on, bitch, it's mine can't you see?",1
"And I rock seventeen, all these knots in my jeans",1
"Me and Zoo turnin' up,",1
got your boo in the cut,1
And she sue cause it's looking like the roof going up,1
"Counting all this bread, I don't talk to feds",1
"Try and take my bitch, you gonna take two to the head",1
"Cause baby you the baddest,",1
"all this money, I'ma cash it",1
And I'm swervin' all in traffic,1
While I'm trapping out the mansion,1
And I'm moving through the tri-state,1
Do two-hundred on the highway,1
And I'm swerving in my i8,1
"Baby, you should come my way",1
Squad!,1
