"If you look close, see a tear dropping",0
"Don't answer the door, that's the jakes knocking",0
"Don't answer the phone, don't know who's ringing",0
I didn't wanna stop till the crew's winning,0
I swear I had a plan and a true vision,0
They closed down the youth clubs and build a new prison,1
"Just lost my pops, I weren't close with him",0
But it felt like part of my soul's missing,0
Gotta move on cuh the world keeps spinning,0
Take it from the streets but the streets in him,0
"Had to tell a queen, ""Just keep grinning",0
"Cuh your self-esteem needs refilling""",0
"Just fucked up my zoot, it needs re-billing",0
Metaphor for the life that I been living,0
Cuh I bit one fruit and it was forbidden,0
See your life fall apart from one poor decision,0
"It's only when you're stressed, you turn to religion",0
If you wanna conquer them then cause a division,0
"Yeah, I make a lot of bread but I'm stuck in the system",0
There's no one like me cuh I'm one in million,0
Never ask for your help but ask for assistance,0
"I don't ever say nothing, I watch from a distance",0
Every story I tell is non-fiction,0
"Came out the court, they gave me my bail conditions",0
What's the point in being free when your brain's in prison?,0
I'm by myself but I'm still with the coalition,0
"You don't make moves, you're only just hoping and wishing",0
Criticise me when your gang do a whole leap of snitching,0
"It's the remix ignition, hot and fresh out of the kitchen",1
"If Shaytan prayed today, would he be forgiven?",1
"From an adolescent, I never learned my lesson",0
"If my name was Smith, they'll have to add a Wesson",1
"See my aggression, I left a bad impression",0
Self-medicate myself through my depression,0
"All I need is money, man, I'm more than eager",0
"I need to be a man, I need to be a leader",0
"I need to bun a zoot, I need to bun a reefer",0
"It's Meek Mill and Omelly, nah, that's Hus and Creepa",0
"The way I've been roasting, I think I need a diva",0
"Big bunda, she in the Bundesliga",1
"But every time I bust, I wish I never seen her",1
"It's like every time I bust, I catch an amnesia",1
All I need is my notes and my calculator,0
I've been out of town tryna' stay off the radar,0
Cut the tension with a razor,0
The next,0
rare tear,1
gon' come with a laser,0
"Sweet talker, smooth operator, you ain't never gonna shine cuh you're a big hater",0
"Make 50 mil, become an innovator, before I get taken away by the Malaikah",1
"Risk taker, not a compromiser, that's why I had to run away from a coloniser",0
"Never had a childhood like Lizzie McGuire, so I had to stack up and invest in a fire",0
"Why wait for the return of the Messiah, when they scheming on me now, when they try to conspire?",0
"Yeah, I lost a lot of faith but now I pray harder",0
Still had to put a bullet in a slave master,0
Came looking for me like a couple days after,0
"They don't know I'm clued up, I play the game smarter",0
All I see is bare opps and bare Garda,1
"If I don't see you now, I'll see you in the hereafter",0
Light a zoot and then I speak to my forefathers,0
"Still now, I don't have all the answers",0
"Movers and shakers, not break-dancers",0
You still ain't blown but you had all the chances,0
I know you feel the force but you can't stop it,0
"Yeah, you can see it but you can't touch it",0
Take me for a fool but I'm far from it,0
"Now we shot lyrics, not narcotics",0
How dare you put money in my opps' pockets?,0
My mood goes up and down like the stock market,0
I had to finish it but I didn't start it,0
I'm just a black-hearted black bastard,0
You heard the tec blasting and then the mac blasted,0
The time your whole block got bombarded,0
"There's a war going on, don't close your eyelids",0
"I just raised hell, that's how I'll raise my kids",0
"I didn't bang off, I just brandished it",0
I saw a bad man doing gymnastics,0
"Saw your whole gang, they was jumping ship",0
Big Bonsam make you jump when it kicks,0
Heard man chatting on a YouTube clip,0
The way I turn up and then cause an eclipse,0
Had a ting spitting fire like Charlie Clips,1
Had to get a safe-house out in the sticks,0
"Bare mash and corn, not rice and peas",0
Dot all my I's and I cross all my T's,1
"She wan' eat me while I'm smoking trees, too much chocolate give you diabetes",0
I hopped out the ride and I done a baiteze,0
Gyal love me but they say I'm crazy,0
"We spin in your ends, start talking grease",0
"If you love me, you're gon' get on your knees",1
Her milkshake brought me to her yard like Kelis,1
"Long time, you ain't had a real good squeeze",1
"I don't want the whole cake, I just get a piece",0
Had to make a one move and go and get a cheese,0
Why these police wan' put me on a leash?,0
I can't even- I can't even roll in peace,0
"If you want a hook, that's like a hundred G's",0
Just wait for my tape to release,0

It Sounds Like Nyge,1
