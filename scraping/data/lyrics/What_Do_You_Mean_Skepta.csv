[Chorus: J Hus],0
The hustle is still in my genes,0
"When I fell asleep, I was still in my jeans",0
Then I had a one gyal licking me clean,0
She wan' eat man like Idi Amin,1
What do you mean? I come for the cream,0
I made some mistakes that I gotta redeem,0
You put me in position that I don't wanna be in,0
"We all make mistakes, I'm a human being",0
"North Korean, Kim Jong-un when I spray the machine",0
You're on the other side if you ain't on my team,0
[Verse 1: Skepta],0
You get blacklisted if you hate on my team,1
"Fam, I say what I mean, I keep my demons close",0
"Late night, I speak to the ghost",0
"Get high, fell asleep in my clothes",0
"Animal instinct, sex, money, murder, I fear nobody",0
"Keep suttin' on me, 'cause I'm better safe than sorry",0
I'm a top boy like Sully with a six figure hobby,1
"You're still on the road, better be getting that belly",0
"Kicking off doors, better give it some welly",0
"I came in the game, ran it like an athlete",0
"Got a big money scheme, all my bruddas had to eat",0
"Thought I was a scrub, sitting in the backseat",0
"I was counting my money, making sure it's complete",0
"They can't compete, there ain't no competition",0
"I take what I want, you get what you were given",0
"They calling me a rapper, man, I think I'm a magician",0
"I didn't wanna kill 'em, but these niggas never listen",0
[Chorus: J Hus],0
The hustle is still in my genes,0
"When I fell asleep, I was still in my jeans",0
Then I had a one gyal licking me clean,0

"North Korean, Kim Jong-un when I spray the machine",0
You're on the other side if you ain't on my team,0
[Verse 2: Skepta],0
As soon as I wake up I be chasing my dreams,0
All we do is win and we ain't changing the teams,0
I still creep through the hood,0
Pull up on my brudda just to see if he's good,0
"See them with the gang, they be giving me looks",0
"See him on his ones, I can see that he's shook",0
Mad 'cause I made it,0
New whip looking like a spaceship,0
You looking like you're stuck inside the Matrix,0
"I could teach you how to hustle, how to save it",0
"When the money talks, I can translate it",0
I'm the go-getter,0
"G'd up with my feet up, it's no pressure",0
"They make threats, but they never put their hands on me, they know better",0
"You will get pepper, hot like Coachella",0
"You're not clever, you're coming unstuck",0
"I was up North, I was getting 'nuff love",0
"Back down South, tryna make a young buck",0
And I'll be still going when the sun comes up,0
(Greaze),0
