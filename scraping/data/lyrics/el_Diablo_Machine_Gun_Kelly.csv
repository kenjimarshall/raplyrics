Tell all my competition that I love 'em,0
But I brought 'em back just to kill 'em again,0
"Tell all the listeners that I said, ""Fuck 'em""",1
If they thought I'd never be breathing again,1
I keep some drink in the cup,0
"In case anyone got some more beef, I can eat 'em again",1
I made a promise to beat their ass up,1
Like Adonis if I ever meet 'em again,1
[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly],0
"Fuck your big bro, uh",0
We the ones that got it when the rent's low,0

I got a combination to a safe in the back of the bank,0
That be storing my shit,0
Just had a conversation with a girl that I dated,0
Now she out here whoring and shit,0
I got a reputation to be going and showing up,0
4 in the morning and shit,0
I had an altercation down in Florida,0
I threw his face on the floor of the shit,0
[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly],0
"Fuck a bitch, though, huh",1
"Y'all ain't want us before we was rich, ho",1
"I can't go back to this shit, I need a castle and shit, I'm on some Dracula shit",0
I used to have to heat up pans of water to shower,0

Diablo,0
Stop the debate if my name isn't mentioned,1
In this generation as one of the greatest,1
From lyrics to cadence,1
I changed the way rappers rock out on them stages,1
"I saw people take it, and they were more famous",1
"So I ain't get credit, I had to be patient",1
I know people hate me just by my appearance,0
"You motherfuckers can't be serious, ayy",0
[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly],0
"I shoot dice, yeah, gamble with my life, yeah",0
