[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract],1
"I can barely rap, I can barely dance",0
"I can barely laugh, I can barely hang",0
I want a male stripper to do a belly dance,0
"For me and my boyfriend, that's entertainment",0
"And I'm drunk as fuck, my niggas tuxed up",0
I need a reason to get my bucks up,0
I need a reason to care about society,0
They need a good enough reason just to hire me,0
"But honestly, you see my mom can't walk",1
And her lungs don't work like they used to,1
I feel like it's my fault 'cause of music,1
"I be saying shit that's just fucking rude and untrue, and",1
"But truthfully, the words had damage, and it's cruel to me",1
But even more cruel to be,1
Dissing you in front of niggas that pay to hear me,1
[Bridge: Kevin Abstract],0
"Sometimes I be wondering, why I been tripping off it",0
I should probably spend my time,0
Writing rhymes in the dentist's office,1
That's killing two birds in one stone,1
"When I was younger, way before I was grown",1
I wanted a deal with Death Row or Rhymesayers,1
I'm saving my time for mics later,0
"I might save it, depending on the shit that y'all write later",0
"I hate writers, I hate tweets, I hate journalists",0
"They hate truth, they hate peace",0
They want my niggas to burn with us,0
[Verse 2: Joba],0
Flicking on the face of my wrist watch,1
"Watch the time stop just to speed up, watch life unfold",1
"And between the tick-tocks, speeding down the one-way",1
"Fuck these signs, fuck these lights, put my life on the line",1
"When it feel right, I'm fine, no, I'm not lyin', don't ask me",1
"I'll pay the fine, I'll pay the toll, just hope I don't crash it",1
"But hey, if I do, it will be a blaze of glory",0
Engulfed by the manifestation of death behind me,0
All my life I've felt inadequate,0
And through the years I've dealt with,0
"Tragedy after tragedy, God, send a message",0
Send a messenger my way,0
"Never claimed to be a saint, forgive me",0
Feel like the light that I was blessed with has diminished,0
"I'm haunted, by the visions of my youth turned true",0
I've come to expect my expectations aren't true,0
But I'm a master of believing my lies,0
"And you can't break me, and I can't brake at the speed of light",0
[Verse 3: Matt Champion],0
"I'm afraid to share the bed, what if she want money later?",1
"Like she got laid off, uh, hit my lawyer for some paper",1
"I'm afraid to speak my pains like, ""You lucky where you at""",0
"""You cool, but quit complaining 'bout all that""",0
That's why I'm showing up late,0
"I'm not tryna be a dick, but my time is not to waste",0
"For myself, for the small talk with my sensei",0
Where my sense at? Four-cylinder go round,0
"Lincoln Town Car pick me up, drop me off",0
"I got bubble under my biceps, sneak me into the sidestep",0
"Ego is getting sized up, I be on butterfly effect",1
"Fuck it, I'll be myself now, tell 'em I take no shit now",1
"Tell 'em they work for me now, tell 'em my tears, they bleed down",1
"Tell 'em I work, like, what, what time for me now?",0
"Wondering ""who is me?"" now",0
"Wondering ""where you been?"" now",0
"Lose you in crowds, I see now, 14",1
I see 'em all inside of me now,1
Bank account move like speeds now,0
Make it from ways to feed now,0
Thinking of ways to be everything but right now,0
[Verse 4: Dom McLennon],0
It's crazy how things feel the best,0
When reminiscing 'til we check ourselves,0
It's crazy how people who left,0
Say they feeling left out when we step for health,0
Still accustomed to nights filled with solitude,0
I don't always remember to call goodnight,0
I don't always remember my altitude,0
I don't always remember to stop the fight,0
"But I might check my sight, it ain't right",0
"Yeah I know, but my strife overwhelms, every night",0
Until I'm forced to close my eyes,0
"Brain disease, parasite, eating me from inside",0
"Emotions bleed, I can't believe",0
How I'm slipping through the night,0
