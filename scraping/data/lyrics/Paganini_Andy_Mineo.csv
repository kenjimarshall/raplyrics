"Hit 'em with the old to the flow that I grew up on, then I grew up on 'em",1
"And funny now how I flow for Hova, heh",1
"Words twisted, but yo, I'm sober, uh",1
Never really been the type to pour up,1
When I get this thing goin' I don't like to slow up,1
Mouth movin' like a motor when I bite the flow up,1
"But I bet they won't stop, let me go, let me go, woo",0
I'ma show off every ability God's given me to go off in,0
Nobody mad about the beauty of the Vatican and the tabernacle,0
So when I'm rappin' you can add it in,0
Breakin' 'em with the shatter,0

"Comin' out the pocket like, everybody get to rockin' doin' the Paganini",0
"Killin' the beat, my tongue is like a violin",0
Give it to 'em like I'm not a human,0
When I'm doing what I'm doing,0
Keepin' it comin' like an automatic shooter,0
When we get to rippin' it ridiculous,0
And everybody gets to speakin' about these driven brothers that's goin' in again,0
But they don't know even when they got that flow (Got that flow),0
"I don't know why they boast, everybody's gifts borrowed (look)",0
"Producers, directors, skilled architectures",0
Do what they do to whom they're connected,0
True was the God that chooses to bless them,0
Who is the one you think they reflectin'?,1

"Comin' to cut 'em and hit 'em harder,",1

Blat! Blat!,0
Mineo and Kevin got adrenaline,0
Comin' to drill 'em with the real gospel,0
Comin' up to the game,0
"Still the same, bigger the name, bigger the fame",0
To the glory they follow Him and the Father,0
While I'm comin' and killin' the game,0
I'm breakin' 'em off and we know,0
They steady tryna imitate the steelo,1
"I'm hittin' with the fire, spittin' super wild",1
Runnin' with the young and unashamed,1
"I'm Paganini on a kilo, amigo",1
[Chorus: Andy Mineo],0
"Uh-huh, yeah (God given)",0
