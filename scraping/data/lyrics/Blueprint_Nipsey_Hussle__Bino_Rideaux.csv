[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle],0
Easy to spot me like Lil Yachty,1
Red ambient light luminate the big body,1
Bro hand me a sprite na fuck it alkaline me,1
Had to rise from the grave but ain't a nigga out climb me,1
Take it to trial and beat all charges,0
Pull up in Rarri and ball hard,0
Watching me take this shit way farther,0
Now they can tell I was way smarter,0
[Hook: Bino Rideaux],0
Cause you came from hood things,0
This life it got good things about it too,0
And now we push Blue Wraith,0
Got the whole hood singing about you,0
And you can't stop,0
"Oh no you can't stop no, oh no you can't stop no",0
All that pressure but it can't defeat you,0
They don't know the block like we do,0
(Whooa),0
They don't know the block like we do,0
"(Been too many years out here nigga, 7days a week)",0
They don't know the block like we do,0
"(Police raids, the shootouts, the wars, the hatred)",0
They don't know the block like we do,0
"(10 toes down nigga, we got this)",0
[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle],0
Authentic ain't the word I'm on 63rd,0
Tween Brynhurst and Vic where all them killers were,0
Burgundy your curb burgundy your curb,0
Hit the gas and swerve hit the gas and swerve,0
When it's time to purge I can send the work but I don't send em I go wit em cause I risk adverse,0
And this shit realer than life when you raised so fucked up you start feeling this right,1
When you seen so much death you start dealing with Christ,1
If you ever make it out you give em different different advice,1
Put my truth in this music hope I'm givin' em light,0
Just another flawed human trying to get this shit right,0
Love a strong passion but resist it with pride,0
Too much honor in my heart to let that mickey shit fly,0
750li count another hunnid thou while I ride,0
Stonewashed Fear of God like peanut butter on rye,0
Real shit a nigga touchin' the sky everyday I wake up I refine,1
You see me drinking alkaline,1
By any means i gave you a design,1
I even titled it I put it on my part of the shine,1
Keep shit going every morning I try,0
Long as it's late model foreign I'm fine,0
Lot of pain don't expect me to cry,0
Lot of fails still expect me to try,0
I'm from the gang they expect me to die,0

[Verse 3: Dave East],0
We ain't have no cable but with cane was able,1
To buy my momma groceries before she made the table,1
I seen niggas die over a conversation,0
Young with a gun speedin' through life with no kinds of patience,0
You can smell the murder while the kids playin',1
Enemies on top of enemies the pigs hate us,1
New nina open your chest up like Vick's Vapor,1
Ballin' in New York they confusin' me with a Knick's player,0
Burgundy your block burgundy your block,0
Was servin' smokers in the spot till cuzzo served a cop,0
He ain't look like no police he bought it by the piece,0
His daughter I call her my niece so she gon' always eat,0
I'm focused like Mohammed with a speed bag,0
"Ski masks, you ain't seeing faces when we need that",0
Arm and Hammer powder in my finger nails,0
Got more stripes than a Adidas sale I seen a jail,1
Was eating tuna as a I read my mail,1
Everywhere I go now they feel me like they reading braille,0
I might be a demon I seen shit I never need to tell,0
"Two guns up, Lennox to King Park, two thumbs up",0
"Beans and Bleek, Who want what?",0
We was off surviving off of samples,1
Homies dying lit the block up like a blunt with the candle,1
So fuck your code of ethics we just showin' progression,0
All that tough shit out your window the minute you show your weapon,0
Harlem,0
