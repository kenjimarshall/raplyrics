Dru Hill come on,0
[Verse 1: Dru Hill],0
I got this feeling,0
I can't turn it loose,0
That somebody else is getting next to you,0
Can't walk around,0
Like I was your fool,0
Cause being who I am I can't lose my cool,0
My friends keep telling me bout things going on,0
But deep in my heart babe,0
I hope that I'm wrong,0
[Chorus],0
Somebody's sleepin' in my bed,0
Messin' with my head,0
Takin' my place,0
(Somebody's sleepin' in my bed),0
Sleepin' in bed,0
Messin' with my head,0
Takin' my place,0
"(Takin my place, Oh oh)",0
[Verse 2],0
I come home early expecting your warm embrace,0
But something's wrong cause it's written on your face,0
(Written on your face),0
Cause it hurts so bad when I walk through the door,0
But you know one thing,0
I ain't comin' back no more,0
Don't try to tell me things are still the same,0
Cause when we made love I heard you call out his name,0
[Chorus],0
Somebody's sleepin' in my bed,0
Messin' with my head,0
Takin' my place,0
(Somebody's sleepin' in my bed),0
Sleepin' in bed,0
Messin' with my head,0
Takin' my place,0
"(Takin my place, Oh oh)",0
[Bridge],0
What else did you want?,0
What else did you need?,0
Giving you everything plus my heart,0
I gave you the world (Yes I did),0
Cause you were my girl (Oh yes I),0
But you still ran out on me,0
[Verse 3: Jermaine Dupri and,0
Da Brat,0
],0
"Uh, fly shit, different colors whips",0
"I got plenty big hits, all kinda dips",0
Got too many,0
"My life ain't complete if I ain't got no buzz
And can't nobody do it like we does
It's a must brat bust and the mic you're handin' me
And represent for the rest of the family",0
Well I'm known for makin' moves on my own big songs,0
And now I keep it comin' strong till the early morn,0
"Lemme interrupt your regular schedule
Twistin' off high levels of bubonic
Chokin' amateurs till they vomit",0
I make em sick cause I'm the williest,0
"Too much for you to deal with
My niggas that ride quick
Survive or die bitch",0
Why switch this remix hurts everyday,0
It's like this and I never stop puttin it in work,0
I rock from L.A. to Dru Hill,0
Something you can feel,0
All I'm about is that dolla dolla bill,0
What the deal?,0
"Funkier than Parliament
Stay bent behind tent
And keep a nigga payin' my rent
My Gaultier scent lingers
VVS describes best what's on the fingers",0
We make believers out of dreamers,0
[Chorus],0
Somebody's sleepin' in my bed,0
Messin' with my head,0
Takin' my place,0
(Somebody's sleepin' in my bed),0
Sleepin' in bed,0
Messin' with my head,0
Takin' my place,0
"(Takin my place, Oh oh)",0
