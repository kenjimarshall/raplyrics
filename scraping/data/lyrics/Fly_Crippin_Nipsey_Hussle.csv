[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle],0
I got a swag when I step,1
Blue rag to the left,1
All the girls know im the biz,0
I think I know what it is,0
"It's fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin'",0
"I got this 40 on my waist, Louis suit case",0
"And I'm tattooed on my neck, my chest, my face",0
"Fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin'",0
[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle],0
"Look, TMC is my new shit",1
I don't make no excuses,0
Fly crip in my blueprint,0
Niggas talk but I do this,0
I gave a AR to my new bitch,0
I had a Rolex before music,0
"Money talks, loud and clear",0
Niggas looking like two cents,0
So we could line them up and we could shoot shit,0
"We could range Rover, Benz coupe shit",0
Turn a couple of zones into a few bricks,0
And turn a couple of bars into a new hit,0
"New Louis bag, new Louis kicks",0
And my trunk right where my roof is,0
Nigga stay in style like I'm boostin',0
How they say they fly when they flew shit,0
"I got tats all on my neck, tats all on my face",0
Get 10 G's so up and I don't hop bout till I pay,0
I drink that Clicquot and that Ace,0
Smoke Kush weed and eat steak,0
She can't resist to fly crip,0
So she get wet when I get on stage,0
And yeah I dropped out in 10th Grade,0
But I fly first class on these planes,0
Never stand in line at my bank,0
All money In is incorporated,0
"They say ""Damn, Hussle you made it""",1
"I said ""No, you just think basic""",1
"And if them niggas fly, then I'm a spaceship",0

What you gonna do next?,0
Take your main bitch and have sex,0
I keep a 40 on my in case a nigga trying to flex,0
"So niggas stop with all that press, cause you ain't gonna do shit",0
"I hear you talking loud, well nigga talk about my dick",0
And how your bitch swallow this,0
You go home and you kiss,0
"But guess what you hater, you be kissing on my dick",0
"No homo trick, she look at you like you a lick",0
She fuck with Cob Supreme 'cause I'm a fly ass young crip,0
I got Polo socks on my feet,0
"Polo draws on my waist, Louis belt on my Levi's",0
And these diamonds be all on me,0
"Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my wrist",0
I look like a robbery but nigga that will be a risk,0
"Ride around in that jag, I roll around in that range",0
But if a nigga walk we are still not the same,0
'Cause I got,0
