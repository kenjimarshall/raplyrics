"""Calling Apollo 9, calling Apollo 9",1
"What is your condition, over""",1
"""Calling NASA, calling NASA",1
"This is Apollo 9, condition green",1
"We've landed on Mars, and all systems are go...""",1

"Yo, it's three thousand thirty",1
"I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, hero, not no small feat",1
It's all heat in this day and age,1
"I'll raid your grave, anything it takes to save the day",1
"Neuromancer, perfect blend of technology and magic",1
Use my rapping so you all can see the hazards,1
Plus entertainment where many are brainless,1
We cultivated a lost art of study,1
and I brought a buddy,1
"Automator, harder slayer, fascinating combinations",1
Cyber warlords are aggravating abominations,0
Arm a nation with hatred? We ain't with that,0
We high-tech archaeologists searching for knick-knacks,1
Composing musical stimpacks that impacts the soul,1
Crack the mold of what you think you rapping for,0
I used to be a mech soldier but I didn't respect orders,1
"I had to step forward, tell them this ain't for us",1
Living in a post-apocalyptic world morbid and horrid,1
The secrets of the past they hoarded,1
Now we just boarded on a futuristic spacecraft,1
No mistakes black it's our music we must take back,1

Del I'm feeling like a ghost in a shell,1
I wrote this in jail playing host to a cell,1
"For the pure verbal, they said my sentence was equivalent to murder",1
"Just another hurdle, I bounced through a portal",0
I knew they had the mindstate of mere mortals,1
My ears morphed to receptors that catch your,1
Every word about gravity control,1
And the families they hold for handsome ransoms,1
"On the run with a handgun, blast bioforms; I am warned",1
That a planet-wide manhunt with cannons,1
"Will make me, abandon, my foolish plan of uprisin'",1
"Fuck dyin, I hijack a mech",1
"Control it with my magical chants, so battle advanced",1
"Through centuries of hip-hop legacy, megaspeed",1
Hyperwarp to Automator's crib and light the torch,1
They can't fight the force,0
Victory is ours once we strike the source,0
Enterprisin' wise men look to the horizon,1
Thinkin' more capitalism is the wisdom,1
"And imprison, all citizens empowered with rhythm",1
We keep the funk alive by talking with idioms,1
[Hook: Del the Funky Homosapien],0
Yo it's three thousand thirty,1
"I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, and Automator",1
Yo it's three thousand thirty,1
"I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, and Automator",1
Yo it's three thousand thirty,1

[Verse 3: Del the Funky Homosapien],0
It's an eternal evil concerned with thievery,0
Medieval prehistoric rhetoric well we ahead of that,0
Lay it down with sound waves that pound pavement,0
Original minstrels my central processing unit,1
Is in tune with my heart for this art,1
Not artificial cause that makes it hard to miss you,0
Copycats finish last in the human race,0
Staying glued to safes too prude to take a buddha break,0
We got espers that let us bless with fresh shit,1
Undetected by yes men questing for five fleeting nanoseconds of fame,1
Protecting the brain from conspiracies against my cosmos,1
While I flow to Neo-Tokyo with Opio,1
Or discuss combustible rust clusters with Plus,1
Evade cyber police in a computer crib,1
confuse the kids,0
But I can make a kickin' rhyme that's sacred,0
Telepathic mind that takes his greatness from the Matrix,1
Esper rhyme professor,1
rushes on colder pressures,0
With correction measures,0
While half the world's a desert,1
Cannibals eat human brains for dessert,1
"Buried under deep dirt, mobility inert",1
I insert these codes for the cataclysm,0
Ever since I had the vision use my magnetism,1
In this modern metropolis that tries to lock us up,1
"Under preposterous laws, it's not for us",1
