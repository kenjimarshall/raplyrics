I've been travelin' for some time,0
With my fishin' pole and my bottle of shine,0
On these long dark dusty roads,0
Lookin' there's nowhere to go,0
"I guess I gotta hide away, far away",0
'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way,0
"I gotta hide away, far away",0
'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way,0
Ayy-ayy-ayy ayy-ayy-ayy ayy,0
[Verse 1],0
I left out from mamma's with my thumb in the wind,0
"The leaves on the ground, winter's comin again",0
Solid on the surface as I crumble within,0
But legends are made out of vulnerable men,0
"So on the brink of death, I still manage livin' life",0
'Cause so rarely in this world are these chances given twice,0
"I indeed sold my soul, without glancing at the price",0
No instructions when I was handed this device,0
"But with what I did get, I was more than generous",0
Put others over self on several instances,0
But I'm back on my feet without a hint of bitterness,0
And one way or another I shall have deliverance,0
So I say:,0

[Verse 2],0
Can you recall a time people loved you unconditionally?,0
"Toast in the new south, this one is for history",0
Then I slipped fell and caused the number's injury,0
Called the same people and it's yo you just missed them B,0
"This the formula, dammit Bubba you had it",0
Why'd you have to keep it Polo and New Balance?,0
Then they start to question whether you a true talent,0
Or just a redneck substance abuse addict,0
So then you hide away just to try to find your way,0
And now they back to callin' you two-hundred times a day,0
"I want all y'all to know, good or bad I'll remember it",0
And ten million sold in the name of my deliverance,0

[Verse 3],0
Nothing could atone for the pain you've endured,0
The blood you shed is still stainin' your velour,0
You took your wealth and knowledge and gave it to the poor,0
Only to discover that your savior's manure,0
"Accepted me as kin, put before your younger brother",0
They put a lot on us hardly knowin' one another,0
I honestly can say that over time I've come to love you,0
"Now we are brothers and together, no one can touch us",0
It haunts me with regret I never met your baby girl,0
She's an angel on your shoulder helpin' us to save the world,0
This musical marriage is no coincidence,0
"On my mamma, Timmy, baby, we shall have deliverance",0
So we say:,0
[Hook],0
I've been travelin' for some time,0
With my fishin pole and my bottle of shine,0
On these long dark dusty roads,0
Lookin there's nowhere to go,0
"I guess I gotta hide away, far away",0
"'Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way",0
"I gotta hide away, far away",0
"'Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way",0
Ayy-ayy-ayy ayy-ayy-ayy ayy,0
