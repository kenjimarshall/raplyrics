"Let's take a nice, deep breath
Slowly exhale
And take a nice, deep breath",0
[Verse: Denzel Curry],0
The Big Bang happened when the black balloon ignited,1
I feel the pain shoulder to shoulder as I was knighted,1
The night turns to day and my days don't seem the brightest,0
"It's like itis, I wanna take a bite out of what life is",0
If the President fuck around and piss off ISIS,0
"Bury me in blueberry bills, jewels, and ices",0
Let's connect from mind to mind,0
"Lies are on the rise, increasin', bigger size",0
Hard to victimize when evil's idolized,0
"Inside my battered mind, I have visions of bein' broke",1
A broken man writin' words of wisdom inside these notes,1
"Shattered and lost, chatterin' talk, blabberin' off",0
"Grabbin' the cross, telling Jes√∫s nothing matters at all, ugh",0
"The black balloon floats, the black balloon flies",1
"The black balloon pops, the black balloon dies",1
I must be the black balloon and,1
The children of the world always meets a doomed end,0
The earth will soon end,0
"We all perish, all parents, all kids, all buried",0
"Cemetery, ceremonious, find me at my loneliest",0
Life is the ugliest bitch I ever messed with,1
But she quick to down that nut back like Nesquik,1
"Never try to take my life, you get your chest hit",0
Countin' paper with Nyyjerya 'til my flesh split,1
"Uh, uh, uh",0
[Chorus: Denzel Curry &,0
Flying Lotus,0

We all cry,1
"The day the black balloon explode, we all die",1
"Nobody couldn't handle the truth, we all lie",1
Then wait to see the real exposed,0
"'Til then, I kick that funky shit until my casket closed",0
"We all cry (Can you save me, baby?)",1
"The day the black balloon explode, we all die",1
"Nobody couldn't handle the truth, we all lie",1
Then wait to see the real exposed (,0
Ooh-ahh,0

"'Til then, I kick that funky shit until my casket closed",0
We all cry,1

"Ooh-ahh
Can you save me, baby?
Ooh-ahh, ahh-ahh-ahh, ahh-ahh
Ooh-ahh, ahh
Can you save me, baby?
Ooh-ahh",0
