[Verse 1: Yung Christ],0
"Took one to the dome, home alone",0
I can't turn a stone without some bones creeping up out of my clothes,0
"Jonesing, fiending, itching, shaking, mentally unstable, no cable",0
Just some white noise inside my head,0
"And that ain’t no wrap sheet, but what I regret instead",0
Days of me and cherry working out the mother fucking shed to get up out of my toxic bed,0
Forsaken the first born and watch the rest fall at glance,1
Wishes of me changing my past never had a fighting chance,0
[Chorus: Yung Plague],0
Leave me alone,0
Leave me alone,0
Leave me alone,0
When I die I want a mural painted of me,0
Leave me alone,0
[Verse 2: Yung Plague],0
When I die I want a mural painted of me,0
"If I'm lucky, they'll pick a building that’s really fucking ugly",1
"Paint me puking, paint me fucking, paint a halo right above me",1
"Even if they tear the building down, Yung Plague will be scattered around",0
Let out the hounds while I'm stepping in your fucking town,0
Always surrounded by the fucking walking dead of clout,1
"Tryna catch a breath, always trying not to fucking drown",1
Ashes to ashes I'll turn to dust before I join the crowd,1
[Chorus: Yung Plague],0
Leave me alone,0
Leave me alone,0
Leave me alone,0
When I die I want a mural painted of me,0
Leave me alone,0
Leave me alone,0
Leave me alone,0
Leave me alone,0
When I die I want a mural painted of me,0
Leave me alone,0
