[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars],0
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad,1
Buy all of the things I never had,1
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine,1
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen,1
[Chorus: Bruno Mars],0
"Oh, every time I close my eyes",0
I see my name in shiny lights,1
", yeah",0
"A different city every night, oh, I, I swear",0
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire,0
[Verse 1: Travie McCoy],0
"Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of",0
"Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list",0
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt,1
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit,1
"Give away a few Mercedes, like, here lady have this",0
"And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish",0
It's been a couple months that I've been single so,1
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho,1
"Aha, get it?",0
I'd probably visit where Katrina hit,0
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did,1
"Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid",0
Everywhere I go I'mma have my own theme music,0
[Chorus: Bruno Mars &,0
Travie McCoy,0
],0
"Oh, every time I close my eyes",0
"(what you see, what you see brah?)",0
I see my name in shiny lights,0
"(Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)",0
"Oh, yeah, yeah, a different city every night, oh, I, I swear",0
The world better prepare,0
(For what?),0
for when I'm a billionaire,0
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, when I'm a billionaire",0
"Oh-oh, oh-oh",0
(Let's go),0
[Verse 2: Travie McCoy],0
I be playing basketball with the president,0
Dunking on his delegates,1
Then I compliment him on his political etiquette,0
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it,0
"But keep the fives, twennies, tens, and bens",1
completely separate,0
"And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket",1
We in recession but let me take a crack at it,0
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up,0
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks,0
And not a single tummy around me,0
Would know what hungry was,0
"Eating good, sleeping soundly",0
I know we all have a similar dream,0
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet,0
And put it in the air and sing,0
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars &,0
Travie McCoy,0
],0
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad (So bad),1
"Buy all of the things I never had (Buy everything, ha ha)",1
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine,1
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen (What up Oprah? Ha ha),1
[Chorus: Bruno Mars &,0
Travie McCoy,0

"Oh, every time I close my eyes",0
"(What you see, what you see brah?)",0
I see my name in shiny lights,0
"(Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)",0
"Oh, yeah, yeah, a different city every night, oh, I, I swear",0
The world better prepare,0
(For what?),0
for when I'm a billionaire,0
"Oh-oh, oh-oh,",0
(Sing it),0
when I'm a billionaire,0
"Oh-oh, oh-oh,",0
(Oh),0

I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad,0
