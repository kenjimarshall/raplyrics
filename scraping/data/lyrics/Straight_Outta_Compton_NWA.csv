[Intro: Dr. Dre],0
You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge,1
[Verse 1: Ice Cube],1
Straight outta Compton!,1
Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube,1
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes,1
"When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off",1
Squeeze the trigger and bodies are hauled off,1
"You too, boy, if you fuck with me",1
The police are gonna have to come and get me,1
"Off your ass, that's how I'm going out",1
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out,1
"Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble",1
"Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo",1
Going off on the motherfucker like that,1
With a gat that's pointed at your ass,1
So give it up smooth,1
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move,1
Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin',1
With a crime record like Charles Manson,1
AK-47 is the tool,1
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool,1
"Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe",1
"I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily",1
"Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly",1
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly,1
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T,1
"Boy, you can't fuck with me",1
"So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck",1
‘Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck,0
"As I leave, believe I'm stompin'",1
"But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton",1
(Compton Compton Compton),0
[Interlude: Eazy E (MC Ren)],0
"Yo, Ren! (Whassup?)",0
Tell 'em where you from!,0
[Verse 2: MC Ren],1
"Straight outta Compton, another crazy ass nigga",1
"More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger",1
"I'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this",1
But the pussy-ass niggas won't show this,1
"But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps",1
"If not from the records, from jacking or craps",1
"Just like burglary, the definition is jacking",1
And when I'm legally armed it's called packing,1
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute,0
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it,1
So if you're at a show in the front row,1
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho,1
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to,1
"But that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to",1
A crazy motherfucker from the street,0
"Attitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit",0
MC Ren controls the automatic,0
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static,0
"Not the right hand, ‘cause I'm the hand itself",1
Every time I pull an AK off the shelf,1
"The security is maximum, and that's a law",1
"R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw",0
"See, ‘cause I'm the motherfucking villain",1
"The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'",0
That's taking place without a clue,0
"And once you're on the scope, your ass is through",1
"Look, you might take it as a trip",0
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip,0
Straight outta Compton,1
(Compton Compton Compton),0
(Straight outta Compton),0
[Interlude: Dr. Dre],0
"Eazy is his name, and the boy is coming…",1
[Verse 3: Eazy E],0
Straight outta Compton,1
Is a brother that'll smother your mother,1
And make your sister think I love her,1
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell,1
"And if I ever get caught, I make bail",1
"See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem",0
"I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him",0
"But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while",0
"And when I see a punk pass, I smile",1
"To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving",1
"But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling",1
Looking for the one they call Eazy,1
"But here's a flash, they'll never seize me",1
"Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark",0
Except when I unload,0
You see a spark and jump over hesitation,1
And hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration,1
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting,0
But leave a memory no one'll be forgetting,0
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!,1
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker,1
This is an autobiography of the E,1
And if you ever fuck with me,0
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother,0
"Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton",0
(Compton Compton Compton),0
(Straight outta Compton),0
[Outro],0
"Damn, that shit was dope!",1
