[Verse 1],0
Go dance,0
'Cause I don't wanna see you with your face down low looking,0
So start a romance,0
You're too young to be old,0
Too damn beautiful,0
One chance,0
"Let's do it, I'm with you",0
"I got your back, baby",0
Just never forget you're a kid,0
That's what you would've said,0
[Chorus],0
And I promise,0
"I will never forget you, never forget you",0
"Always in my heart, in my heart",0
"I, I promise",0
"I'll never forget you, never forget you",0
Always in my heart,0
[Verse 2],0
"Sitting in your hot tub, looking at the stars",0
"Smoke another woo woo, walking over cars",0
Jumping in the pool in the middle of the night,0
"Hooking up in bedrooms, getting in a fight",0
You were,0
You were better than the rest of them,0
You could've put them all together,0
You would've bested them,0
"'Cause you were full of love, never full of shit",0
"Always humble, never arrogant",0
"Heaven-sent with the blue eyes, lagoons, blue moons",0
They'd speak in tongues when you were in the room,0
[Chorus],0
I promise,0
"I will never forget you, never forget you",0
"Always in my heart, in my heart",0
"I, I promise",0
"I'll never forget you, never forget you",0
"Always in my heart, in my heart",0
"I promise, I promise",0
"I will never forget you, never forget you",0
"Always in my heart, in my heart",0
"I, I promise",0
"I'll never forget you, never forget you",0
"Always in my heart, in my heart",0
[Outro],0
She'd turn around and say,0
"It's alright, don't worry 'bout me",0
"I had a good time, sure I didn't wanna leave",0
"But I'll be alright, let it be",0
"Yeah, she'd turn around and say",0
"It's alright, don't worry 'bout me",0
"I had a good time, sure I didn't wanna leave",0
"But I'll be alright, let it be",0
