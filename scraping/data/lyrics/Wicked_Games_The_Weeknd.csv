I don't love her no more,1
And she'll never fucking know that,1

And I emptied out my cards too,1
Now I'm fucking leaning on that,1

"Bring your love, baby, I could bring my shame",1
"Bring the drugs, baby, I could bring my pain",1
I got my heart right here,1
I got my scars right here,1
"Bring the cups, baby, I could bring the drank",1
"Bring your body, baby, I could bring you fame",1
And that's my motherfucking words too,1
Just let me motherfucking love you,1
