[Verse 1],0
"I see you, you on the edge of your seat",1
Ain't you got some place to be?,1
Was hoping the suspense would kill you,1
"Tell me, how would you begin?",1
Watching and waiting to sink your teeth in,1
"Come on and give me your expert opinion, ah, fuck it",1
I settle down in a dump,1
"Heard a crowd screaming ""Jump""",1
So I came to the window,1
(They always wanna kick you when you're down),1
"I said, ""What the fuck have I done?""",1
"They said, ""We just want your blood",1
"You know we like you better in limbo""",1
(They always wanna kick you when you're down),1
[Pre-Chorus],0
"So come on and take a shot, you just can't get enough",1
Don't let the fact that you know nothing stop you talking now,1
"'Cause when all is said and done, my name's still on your tongue",1
[Chorus],0
"But tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?",1
You better pray I don't get up this time around (Ooh),1
And why you tryna put me in the ground?,1
Don't you know I'm a seed? (I'm a seed) I won't stop at the roof,1
"Go ahead, bury me; this is how I grow, it's how I thrive (Ooh)",1
So why you gotta kick me when I'm down? (Down),1
(Why you gotta kick me when I'm down? Ooh),1
[Verse 2],0
"Yeah, I know it's all in good fun, but",1
"Don't say it's coming from love, no",1
I see those arms in akimbo,1
(They always wanna kick you when you're down),1
And don't set that phaser to stun 'cause,1
"What doesn't kill me, well, it better run like hell",1
"Yeah, you better run like hell",1
[Pre-Chorus],0
"So come on and take a shot, you just can't get enough",1
Don't let the fact that you know nothing stop you talking now,1
"'Cause when all is said and done, my name's still on your tongue",1
[Chorus],0
"So tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?",1
You better pray I don't get up this time around (Ooh),1
And why you tryna put me in the ground?,1
Don't you know I'm a seed? (I'm a seed) I won't stop at the roof,1
"Go ahead, bury me; this is how I grow, it's how I thrive (Ooh)",1
[Bridge],0
Remember this line that you crossed,1
Look back and stare at the dot,1
Know there's no turning back now,1
"Now, that you've opened the gates",1
"Corrupted the memory, error, failsafe",1
(Commence the countdown),1
(They always wanna kick you when you're down),1
Remember this line that you crossed,1
Look back and stare at the dot,1
Know there's no way to fix us (No),1
"Oh, God, what the fuck have you done?",1
"I loved you like daughters, I loved you like sons",1
[Chorus],0
"So tell me, yeah, tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?",1
You better pray I don't get up this time around (Ooh),1
And why you tryna put me in the ground?,1
Don't you know I'm a seed? (I'm a seed) I won't stop at the roof,1
"Go ahead, bury me; this is how I grow, it's how I thrive (Ooh)",1
Why you gotta kick me when I'm down?,1
"But tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?",1
"(This is how I grow, it's how I thrive)",1
