"Yeah, I’m back off in this bitch one more time",0
"To drop this rhyme, about where my roots at",0
"Yeah, Westside is in the house",0
Frazier Homes is in the house,0
Cloverdale is in the house,0
"And Savannah, GA is in the house, so check it…",0
[Verse 1: Big Boi],0
"February 1st, 1975 it happened",1
Was born in West Savannah way before I started rappin',1
My mamma had a nigga at the age of fifteen,1
"My daddy was sellin' that sack, now he's gots responsibilities",1
Stayed at me granny's while me mammy was at work,1
And she couldn't watch my every move so shit I started servin',1
"Around Frazier Home, down in the Westside projects",1
"Changin' over foodstamps, and hittin' a lick was next see",0
"I'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased",1
I got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East,1
"So flyin', or floatin', a Brougham is what I'm sportin'",0
Sade is in my tape deck,1
", I'm moving in slow motion, boi",0
So meet me deep in the streets that's where I learned the capers,1
"Us lickin' blunts, lickin' leaves, rolling reefer papers",0
"I'm slightly slouched, in the seats off in my bucket",1
"But the niggas around the Ave. and the hoes, they love me",1
They wanna be me and my family too,1
Because the money that I make be puttin' cable off in every room,1
"So follow the fiends, follow my lead through the nooks and crannies",0
It's everyday life off in my hood so come and holla at me,0
"But go 'head on, with that foolishness bitch",0
Let me get lovely with my swerve because I'm true to this shit,0
"And if you coming with eight dollars, you shit out of luck",1
Because the Westside ain't taking no shorts on the dime,1
So fire it up,1
[Hook: Sleepy Brown],1
"Now, now, now, nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch",0
"Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!",1
"(like that now, like this, and it don't quit, and it don't stop)",0
"Nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch",0
"Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!",1
"(and it don't stop, and it don't quit, it's like that and ah)",0
[Verse 2: Big Boi],0
"See, niggas in the South wear gold teeth and gold chains",0
"Been doing it for years, so these niggas ain't gone change",0
They coming around the ghetto so you might call em soul,0
"Been wearing furry Kangol's, so that shit is old",0
You might slang a rock or two just to pay the rent,0
Five dollars for a table dance so now your money's spent,0
You listen to that booty shake music in your trunk,0
"As long as there's that ""tic tic"" followed by that bump",0
I'm down to stick a ho if she got a G-string,0
"'Cause the niggas in the Point ain't changed, man",1
"You might call us country, but we's only Southern",1
"And I don't give a fuck, P-Funk spot to spark another",1
[Hook: Sleepy Brown],1
"Now, now, now, nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch",0
"Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!",1

"Nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch",0
"Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!",1
"(and it don't stop, and it don't quit, it's like that and ah)",0
"Now, now, now, nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch",0
