"On my back the flyest clothes, looking ill as shit",1
"Transactions illegitimate 'cause life is still a bitch, and then you die",1
"But for now, life, close your eyes and feel this dick",1
"Since diapers, had nothing to live for like them lifers but",1
Making sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher,1
"We paid the price to circle us, success, they turned my mic up",1
I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with some shit that'll light ya life up,1
"If every nigga in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged",1
Nobody will fall 'cause everyone will be each others crutches,1

Ya feelin' it? To all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal my bricks,0
"No doubt, they can vouch my life is real as shit",1
'95 South,1

"What, y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay hot?",0
The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch,1
I keep it tight for all the nights my momma prayed I'd stop,1
Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot,1
"Those nightmares, ma, those dreams that you say you've got",1
"Give me the chills but these mills, well, they make me hot",1
"Y'all don't feel me, enough to stop the illing right?",1
But at the same time these dimes keep me feeling tight,1
"I'm so confused, okay I'm getting weeded now",1
"I know I contradicted myself, look, I don't need that now",1
It's just once in a blue when there's nothing to do,1
And the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through,1
I get to zoning: me and this chick on the island and then we're boning,0
I free my mind sometimes I hear myself moaning,0
"Take one more toke and I leave that weed alone, man",0
"It got me going, shit",0
[Chorus: Mecca],1
"I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët",1
"Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set",1
"I'm feeling it,",0
feel the high that you get from the lye,1
"Feeling it,",0
if you feel it raise your L in the sky,1
"I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët",1
"Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set",1
"I'm feeling it,",0
feel the high that you get from the lye,1
"Feeling it,",0
if you feel it raise your L in the sky,1
"I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët...",0
