"Ah, I stank I can, I stank I can",1
The funky engine that could,1
"Ooh, ooh, yosky, wosky, pisky, wisky",1
All aboard the Stankonia Express,1
The underground smell road,1
Everybody's lookin' for an excuse to let loose,1
"What's your locomotive,",1
the Chatta-nigga choo choo?,1
[Hook: André 3000 + Erykah Badu],0
Humble as a mumble in the jungles,1
Of shouts and screams,1
That's the way the cracker crumbles,1
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams,1
Humble as a mumble in the jungles,0
Of shouts and screams,0
That's the way the cracker crumbles,0
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams,0
[Verse 1: Big Boi],0
"Back on the microphone, your number one controller",1
I rock the microphone like a blizzard,1
I'm so cold I'm tryin' to hold ya,1
Life is like a great big roller coaster,1
Everything in life don't always happen like it's suppose to,1
Trials and tribulations make you stronger live longer,1
You wanna reach the nation nigga start from ya corner,1
Everything don't always happen like you plan it,1
Demand it; over stand it then you handle it,1
"Fuck wishing you, you missing the ambition on your mission",1
Now you switching why you quitting cause it's heated in the kitchen,1
Sloppy slipping in your pimping nigga,0
You either pistol whoop the nigga or you choke the trigger,1
"You've got to follow through, struggle to complete your dreams",1
"""No Weapon Formed Against You Prospers"" 54:17",1
"From Isaiah, lay a, nigga down and spray 'em",1
If the dealer dealt a fucked up hand of cards you've gotta play 'em,1

"Yeah, too Democratic, Republic fuck it",1
"We chicken nugget, we dip in the sauce like mop and bucket",1
"Blue-collar scholars, who'll take your dolla, and wipe my ass with it",0
You living for the lotto never hit it,0
"I met a critic, I made her shit her draws",1
She said she thought Hip Hop was only guns and alcohol,1
"I said ""Oh hell naw!"", but yet it's that too",1
You can't discrima-hate cause you done read a book or two,1
What if I looked at you in a microscope saw all the dirty organisms,1
Living in your closet would I stop and would I pause it,1
"To put that bitch in slower motion,",0
got the potion and the antidote,1
"And a quote for collision, the decision is",1
Do you want to live or wanna exist?,1
"The game changes every day, so obsolete is the fist and marches",1
Speeches only reaches those who already know about it,1
This is how we go about it,1

"I'm wild just like a rock, a stone, a tree",1
And I'm free just like the wind the breeze that blows,1
"And I flow just like a brook, a stream, the rain",1
And I fly just like a bird up in the sky,1
And I'll surely die just like a flower plucked,1
And dragged away and thrown away,1
"And then one day, it turns to clay",1
"It blows away, it finds a ray, it finds its way",1
"And there it lays, until the rain and sun",1
Then I breathe,1
Just like the wind the breeze that blows,1
And I grow just like a baby blossoming,1
And it's beautiful,1
"That's life, that's life",1
"That's life, that's life",1
