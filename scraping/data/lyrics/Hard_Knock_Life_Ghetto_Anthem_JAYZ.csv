[Intro],0
Take the bass line out,0
"Uh-huh, Jigga",0
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah",0
Let it bump though,0
[Chorus],0
It's the hard knock life for us,1
It's the hard knock life for us,1
"Instead of treated, we get tricked",1
"Instead of kisses, we get kicked",1
It's the hard knock life!,1
[Verse 1],0
"From standin' on the corners, boppin'",1
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen,1
From droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard,1
"From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock",1
"Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well",1
"From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell",1
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw,1
"Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots",1
"And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not",1
"I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not",1
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot,1
"Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh",1
"Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh",1
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy,1
"Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!",0
You know it's hell when I come through,1
"The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2",1
Y'all niggas get ready!,1
[Chorus],0
It's the hard knock life for us,1
It's the hard knock life for us,1
"Instead of treated, we get tricked",1
"Instead of kisses, we get kicked",1
It's the hard knock life!,1
[Verse 2],0
I flow for those 'dro'ed out,1
"All my niggas locked down in the 10 by four, controllin' the house",1
We live in hard knocks,1
"We don't take over, we borrow blocks",1
Burn 'em down and you can have it back,1
"Daddy, I'd rather that",1
"I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition",0
"I see your vision, mama",1
I put my money on the longshots,1
All my ballers that's born to clock,1
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not,1
I went from lukewarm to hot,1
Sleepin' on futons and cots to King Size,0
"Green machines, to green 5's",1
"I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills",0
Then I put it down type Braille,0
I'm tight grill with the phony,0
"Rappers, y'all might feel we homies",0
"I'm like, ""Still, y'all don't know me.""",0
"Shit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'",0
I'm tryna murder everything movin' â€“ feel me?,0
[Chorus],0
It's the hard knock life for us,1
It's the hard knock life for us,1
"Instead of treated, we get tricked",1
"Instead of kisses, we get kicked",1
It's the hard knock life!,1
It's the hard knock life for us,1
It's the hard knock life for us,1
"Instead of treated, we get tricked",1
"Instead of kisses, we get kicked",1
It's the hard knock life!,1
[Verse 3],0
"I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes",1
"Got a lotta beef, so logically, I prey on my foes",1
"Hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress",0
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me,0
"I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out",1
Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out,1
"So I stretched the game out, etched your name out",1
"Put Jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga!",1
[Chorus],0
It's the hard knock life for us,1
It's the hard knock life for us,1
"Instead of treated, we get tricked",1
"Instead of kisses, we get kicked",1
It's the hard knock life!,1
