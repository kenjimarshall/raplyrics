[Verse 1],0
And R.I.P. to my youth,1
And you could call this the funeral,1
I'm just telling the truth,1
And you can play this at my funeral,1
Wrap me up in Chanel inside my coffin,1
Might go to hell and there ain't no stopping,1
Might be a sinner and I might be a saint,1
I'd like to be proud but somehow I'm ashamed,1
Sweet little baby in a world full of pain,1
"I gotta be honest, I don't know if I could take it",1
Everybody's talkin' but what's anybody saying?,1
"Mama said if I really want it, then I can change it, yeah",1
R.I.P. to my youth,1
"If you really listen, then this is to you",1
"Mama, there is only so much I can do",1
Tough for you to witness but it was for me too,1
[Chorus],0
I'm using white lighters to see what's in front of me,1
[Verse 2],0
R.I.P. to my youth,1
And you could call this the funeral,1
"I'm just telling the truth, yeah",1
You can play this at my funeral,1
Tell my sister don't cry and don't be sad,1
I'm in paradise with Dad,1
Close my eyes and then cross my arms,1
"Put me in the dirt, let me dream with the stars",1
Throw me in a box with the oxygen off,1
You gave me the key and you locked every lock,1
"When I can't breathe, I won't ask you to stop",1
"When I can't breathe, don't call for a cop",1
I was naive and hopeful and lost,1
"Now I'm aware and driving my thoughts, wow",1
[Bridge],0
What do I do? What do I do?,1
I don't believe it if I don't keep proof,1
I don't believe it if I don't know you,1
I don't believe it if it's on the news or on the Internet,1
I need a cigarette,1
[Chorus],0
I'm using white lighters to see what's in front of me,1
I'm using white lighters to see,1
[Verse 3],0
R.I.P. to my youth,1
And you could call this the funeral,1
I'm just telling the truth,1
And you can play this at my funeral,1
Tell my sister don't cry and don't be sad,1
I'm in paradise with Dad,1
Close my eyes and then cross my arms,1
"Put me in the dirt, let me be with the stars",1
[Outro],0
I'm using white lighters to see what's in front of me,1
I'm using white lighters to see what's in front of me,1
