And she ain't messin' with no other man,0
And me and her have something different,0
I really need all you to understand,0
That nobody's comin' close,0
And I don't ever wanna run around,0
I spent my youth jumpin' in and out,0
But you know I fuckin' love her now,0
Like nobody ever could,0
[Refrain: Ed Sheeran],0

"Together, or solo",0
"It doesn't matter where we are, oh no, no",0
"So, if you hear about my lady, just know",0
"That she ain't the one to play with, oh no",0
And I'll be standin' so close,0
"So you know that, ayy",0

But you don't know that my girl been doin' CrossFit,0
"Pew, kung pow, hit your ass with a cross kick",1
"Pulling hair out, wear you out, you exhausted",1
Know she gonna slide anytime you bitches talk shit,0
"Keep a lil' blade in her fuckin' lip gloss kit, ayy",0
No one say hi to me without her,0
