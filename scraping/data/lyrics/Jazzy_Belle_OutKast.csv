[Verse 1: André 3000],0
Oh yes I love her like Egyptian,1
Want a description? My royal highness,1
So many plusses when I bust that there can’t be no minus,1
Went from yelling crickets and crows,1
Bitches and hoes to queen thangs,1
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs,1
"Like Kilroy,",1
chill boy because them folks might think you soft,1
"Talking like that, man, fuck them niggas, I’m going off",1
And coming right back like boomerangs when you throw 'em,1
With these old ghetto poems,1
", thinking it's better for 'em",0
When they can let they thumb down from hitchhiking,1
Inviting niggas into the temple they call their body,1
"Now everybody got it, had it, talked about it amongst they friends",1
"Coming around my crew looking Jazzy, wanna pretend",1
Like you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes,1
",",0
even Bo knew that you got poked,1
Like acupuncture patients,1
"While our nation is a boat, straight sinking",1
I hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chill'un,1
They fucking a different nigga every time they get the feeling to,1
I’m willing to go the extra kilometer,1
Just to see my señorita get her pillow,1
On the side of my bed where no girl ever stay,1
House and doctor was the games we used to play,1
But now it’s real Jazzy Belle,1
[Verse 2: Big Boi],0
"See what if you was a playa, real playa not no flaw",1
"Having the very best of life: lobster, steak and Perignon",1
Smoking an ounce of weed,1
And every single day was personal FreakNik,1
"Tricking these hoes in Polo clothes, life as you conceived it",1
"But your conception, deception, looking into your eyes",1
I see your weapon and it’s depressing,1
"They're digging up in your thighs, leaving deposits",1
"Keeping your closets open, knocking your boots and drawers",1
Hoping to get you sprung like bail-bonds,1
Steadily calling me Antwan 'cause you thinking that you my lady,1
"Bitch, don’t play me 'cause you’re janky",1
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie we got danky,0
"So thank thee, for running that Southerplayalistic game",0
"You was the only one to blame, a nigga don’t even know yo name",1
"It’s a shame, you cracking 'em up and fucking a nigga like 2Pac up",1
I’m leaving these foes to be the flowers and wake don’t get me,0
"See, I gotta be feeding my daughter",1
Teach her to be that Natural Woman,1
'Cause you’ll be Waiting to Exhale while you other hoes be Dumb,1
"And Dumber, yeah, you know what I’m saying",1
[Verse 3: André 3000],0
See me and ol' girl in the black-on-black 'Lac Northstar,1
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are,1
Talk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra,1
"Straps, sticking together like grandma and grandpa-pa",1
In this dog-eat-dog world,1
Kitty cats be scratching on my furry coat to curl,1
Up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits,1
"I want to earl, 'cause most of the girls",0
"That we was liking in high school, now they dyking",0
[Verse 4: Big Boi],0
"Having no mercy for the disrespectful ones, some",1
"Be hanging around the crew looking for funds, dumb",1
"Deaf and fine,",1
they be asking me all about mine,1
"How she doing how she be, I know she’s sipping that wine",1
Behind my back they squawk like vultures,1
Off and On like Trends of Cultures baby,1
Hey he faking it like these sculptured nails,1
But they can go to hell and lay with Lucifer,1
"'Cause they burning anyway, Big Boi use her and abuse her",1
