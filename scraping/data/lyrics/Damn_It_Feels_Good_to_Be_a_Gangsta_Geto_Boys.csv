[Verse 1: Scarface],0
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta,1
A real gangsta-ass nigga plays his cards right,0
A real gangsta-ass nigga never runs his fucking mouth,0
Cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't start fights,0
And niggas always gotta high cap,1
Showing all his boys how he shot 'em,0
But real gangsta-ass niggas don't flex nuts,0
Cause real gangsta-ass niggas know they got em,0
And everything's cool in the mind of a gangsta,0
Cause gangsta-ass niggas think deep,0
Up three-sixty-five ayo 24/7,0
Cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't sleep,0
And all I gotta say to you,0
"Wannabe, gonnabe, cock sucking, pussy-eating pranksters",0
Is when the fire dies down what the fuck you gonna do,0
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta,0
[Verse 2: Bushwick Bill],0
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta,0
Feeding the poor and helping out with their bills,0
Although I was born in Jamaica,1
Now I'm in the U.S. making deals,1
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta,0
I mean one that you don't really know,1
Riding around town in a drop-top Benz,0
Hitting switches in my black '64,1
Now gangsta-ass niggas come in all shapes and colors,0
Some got killed in the past,0
But this gangsta here was a smart one,0
Started living for the Lord and I'll last,0
Now all I gotta say to you,0
"Wannabe, gonnabe, pussy eating, cock sucking prankstas",0
When the shit jumps off what the fuck you gonna do,0
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta,0
[Verse 3: Scarface],0
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta,0
A real gangsta-ass nigga knows the play,0
The real gangsta-ass niggas get the flyest of the bitches,0
Ask that gangsta-ass nigga Lil J,0
Now bitches look at gangsta-ass niggas like a stop sign,0
And play the role of Little Miss Sweet,0
"But catch the bitch all alone get the digits, take her out",1
And end up hittin' the ass with the meat,1
Cuz gangsta-ass niggas be the game playas,0
And everythings quiet in the clique,0
A gangsta-ass nigga pulls the trigger,0
And his partners in the posse ain't tellin' off shit,0
Real gangsta-ass niggas don't talk much,1
All ya hear is the black from the gun blast,1
And real gangsta-ass niggas don't run for shit,0
Cuz real gangsta-ass niggas can't run fast,0
Now when you in the free world talkin' shit do the shit,1
Hit the pen and let a mothafucka shank ya,0
But niggas like myself kick back and peep game,0
Cuz damn it feels good to be a gangsta,0
"(""And now, a word from the President."")",1
[Verse 4 - J. Prince],0
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta,1
Getting voted in to the White House,1
Everything looking good to the people of the world,0
But the Mafia family is my boss,0
So every now and then I owe a favor getting down,1
Like letting a big drug shipment through,1
And send 'em to the poor community,1
So we can bust you know who,1
So voters of the world keep supporting me,0
And I promise to take you very far,0
Other leaders better not upset me,1
Or I'll send a million troops to die at war,1
"To all you Republicans, that helped me win",1
I sincerely like to thank you,1
â€™Cause now I got the world swinging from my nuts,1
And damn it feels good to be a gangsta,1
