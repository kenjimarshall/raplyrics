"Inslumnational, underground",1
Thunder pounds when I stomp the ground (woo),1
Like a million elephants and silverback orangutans,1
You can't stop the train,1
Who want some? Don't come unprepared,0
"I'll be there, but when I leave there",0
Bet I be a household name,1
Weather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain,1
"So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soakin' wet",1
"In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat",1
Hit somersaults without the net,1
But this'll be the year that we won't forget,1
"1-9-9-9, Anno Domini",1
"Anything goes, be what you wanna be",1
Long as you know consequences,1
"Are given for livin', the fence is",1
Too high to jump in jail,1

"Get a life, now they on sale",1
Then I might cast you a spell,1
Look at what came in the mail,1
A scale and some Arm and Hammer,1
Soul gold grill and a baby mama,1
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers,1
Stack of questions with no answers,1
"Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS",1
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days,1
"Get back home, things are wrong",1
"Well, not really, it was bad all along",1
Before you left adds up to a ball of power,0
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour,1
"Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe",1
"Believe there's always more, ah!",0

"Uno, dos, tres, it's on",1
Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone?,1
Like that there boy and will still stay street,1
Big things happen every time we meet,1
"Like a track team, crack fiend, dyin' to geek",1
OutKast bumping up and down the street,1
"Slantback, Cadillac, 'bout 5 niggas deep",1
75 MCs freestyling to the beat,1
"'Cause we get crunk, stay drunk, at the club",1
"Should have bought an ounce, but you copped a dub",1
"Should have held back, but you throwed a punch",1
Supposed to meet your girl but you packed a lunch,1
No D to the U to the G for you,1
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo,1
"Got a little baby girl four year, Jordan",1
Never turn my back on my kids for them,1
"Should have hit it, quit it, rag top",1
"Before you re-up, get a laptop",1
"Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals",1
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coals,1

"Hold up, slow up, stop, ""Control""",1
"Like Janet,",1
"plan it, Stankonia's on ya",1
"Moving like Floyd, coming straight to Florida",1
Lock all your windows then block the corridors,1
Pulling off a belt 'cause a whipping's in order,1
Like a three-piece fish 'fore I cut your daughter,1
"Yo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border",1
Pitty pat rappers trying to get to 5,1
I'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive,1
"When you come to ATL, boy, you better not hide",1
"'Cause the Dungeon Family gon' ride, hah!",1
