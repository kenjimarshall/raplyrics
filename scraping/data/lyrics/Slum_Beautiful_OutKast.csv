And thank her for spending time with your daddy,1

And can I come there frequently,0

What I like to do most is spit this game like sports announcers,1
And will pity pat them hoez down like a gentlemen club bouncer,1
"Ounce of killa dilla, be making my game more flagrant",1
And once I done had some Cuervo 'bout six shots I'm nothin to play wit,1
"Like plug sockets and babies, possums, raccoons, and rabies",1
Maybe Lady Luscious oba kaybee so they say thee,0
An old school playa pimp type ass nigga like Tony Mercedes,1
And will work every last muscle off in your body like Billy Blanky,1
"Hanky panky, where did you get your gold grill cause it's banging",0
And I like them red hot Fila straight from Walters off the chain,1
Fuck them bouige bitches they don't know nothin 'bout you,1
"Cause you push a big black Buick, so fresh, so clean on them Trues",1
"Slum beautiful you's the world to me, shawty I dig ya",1

"Look at you, unbelievably, brilliant beautiful you",1
You're looking deliciously divine darling you really and truly do,1
The very thought of has got me running at the speed of love,1
Exploring everything about you from the ground to the God above,1
"Suddenly I started dreaming, traveling in time so fast",1
I could almost taste outer space,1
I saw the face of God and looked like you and me too,1
"Hello, I'm the man that God made you for",1
"Profound don't think, okay let's put this poetry in motion",0
I'm shining simply because mother earth I'm your son,0
Our entire circumference engulfed in emotion,0
Forever's gonna be so fun,1

"I don't know but, it seem like uh, your daddy must have gave you",1
A teaspoon of honey every night before you went to bed,1
Or was it a pack of Now & Laters cause you're the sweetest thing on my head,1
And I'd like to say that I'd love to make love to every molecule of you,1
And if you want to spontaneously combust that's what we'll do in unison,1
