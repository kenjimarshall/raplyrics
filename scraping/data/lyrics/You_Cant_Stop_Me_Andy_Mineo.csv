[Verse 1: Andy Mineo],0
"Huh, can't stop, won't stop",1
Where the brakes at?,1
I give 'em that Diddy Bop,1
"Like take that, take that, take that, take that",1
"I'mma put in work, I'mma do that ASAP",1
Throw my faith in rap,1
"But they say don't say that, huh?",1
What I'ma turn down for?,1
I feel like Shaq in '94,1
Breaking glass in that backboard,1
"Or like Kobe in Toronto, huh",1
Droppin' 81,1
",",0
"yo, I drop the 88",1
"Ricky Bobby, shake and bake",1
Sleepin' on us shoulda stayed awake,1
Everybody make mistakes like VJs tryna say my name,1
"It's Mineo, say it with me, Mineo",1
"Okay, great",1
"Two forks high, raise the stakes",1
"Risk it all, I take the hate",1

You're my biggest opponent,1
"You know me, I know you, we know it",1
Whenever I fail you've always been there to simply remind me I've blown it,1
You don't see when I'm growin',1
You don't see where I'm goin',1
You only see in the moment,0
"You know my mistakes, you never let go it",0
"Huh, don't cease to amaze me and it drives me crazy, huh",1
"That you catch every detail that I miss in the songs I'm makin', sayin'",1
You will never write a verse like Kendrick,1
Never be to rap what rock got from Hendrix,1
Top 10 alive you will never be mentioned,1
"Why aim so high, won't survive the trenches",1
"Plus, you a Christian Andy, they will never listen Andy",1
"Plus, your a pigment Andy?",1
"You don't got skill, you a gimmick Andy",1
"Well, if I listen to you and everything you put in my ear",0
"I'll be livin' like woulda, shoulda, coulda",0
I'll be paralyzed by fear,0
"Huh, ain't that the truth, if I quit the only way I lose",1
"I got two choices when I do this, make moves or make excuses",1
"Huh, if you know who I'm talkin' about, then you got me",1
"My biggest enemy is me, and even I can't stop me",0
