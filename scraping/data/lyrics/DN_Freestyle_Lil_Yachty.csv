"Uh, all day I'm rocked up",0
Plottin' on a bad bitch to come and suck dick,0
Cook French toast and clean the bathroom,0
"There's piss all on the floor, bitch, go clean it up",0
"Nigga, soaked in sauce, boy, they fiendin' up",0
Every night you pussy niggas dream you us,0
"Yeah, you signed a deal but you ain't seein' us",0
"200k, I coulda bought a Bentley Truck",1

Better put your guns up,0
I wouldn't go toe to toe with you niggas unless it's for guap,0
"Pussy boy, get your funds up",0
"18 years old, I made my first million",1
Now I'm tryna make 100,1

Finesse that lil' bitch right up out them Gucci chains,0
