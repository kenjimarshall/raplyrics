I'll call before I come,1

I'll call before I come,1
"I won't just pop up over, out the blue",1
"No, after you",1
[Verse 1: Andre 3000],0
"Oh, thank you Lord for throwing some shy",1
Bones in my body let me tell you why,1
"If not so, I'd be too, too bad",1
When it comes to pink polka dots and plaids,1
"Glad to meet you, my name is Dre",1
But you can call me Possum Aloysuis Jenkins,1
Andre 3000 for short,1
And naaw I don't want to see your thongs,1
I kinda dig them old school cute regular draws,1
And I will pause for your cause,1

[Verse 2: Big Boi],0
"I'm a gentleman, I'm a satisfy your soul",1
And then I'm a get mine,1
Like Wimbledon we back and forth across the court,1
"Until we give out,",1
do you take it all or spit it out,1
Are you faking the funk and living a lie,1
Do you really know what it feels like,1
To have no control over the G spot?,1
It's like a brand new pair of Reeboks or a junkie freshly detoxed,1
You feel the tingling all over like convulsions or the rooster pox,1
I used to not give a damn,1
But now I make it a point just to please you,1
"So you can go back and tell all your buddies, I Pretty D'd you",1

[Verse 3: Gangsta Boo],1
Let's see what you wanna do with the Gangsta Boo,1
"Let's cut, nigga, nigga what, I'll cut you too",1
"Coming through in a Escalade limo, tint with shade",0
Purple haze in the ashtray ready to get a blaze,1
What the biz nigga jump on in relax wit a lady,1
Wit a reputation known for sexing niggas till they crazy,1
"Whatcha mean dog, telling a playa like Boo to call before I come",1
You a game I'm fucking on you for fun,1
Join the bandwagon nigga it's a Gangsta Boo party,1
Everybody wanna join come and freak wit somebody,1
"Riding Jaguars, riding Prowlers all sports cars",1
"Hitting strip bars wit the top down, fuck y'all",0

Do me and tell all my friends you truly blew me,0
Bitch,0

[Verse 4: Eco],0
Nigga you better dial 404-584 well bump all that,1
But shit you'd better call before you get here and that's a fact,1
Before you get your feelings hurt,1
Because you caught me playing nurse,1
Wit a stethoscope running around in one of those cute short white skirts,1
"I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't respond to Aloysius",1
Peeped in the window saw me cooking shrimp,1
In high heels and washing dishes,1
For Daddy Fat Sax and it was something I couldn't explain,1
"I know it's a dirty, dirty game, but you should've called before you came",0
