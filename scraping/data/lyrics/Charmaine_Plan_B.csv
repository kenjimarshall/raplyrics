[Verse 1],0
The first day I saw her was at the train station,0
She was half black half Caucasian,0
"At first yo, I thought she was Asian",0
But as I get a bit closer her origin is blatent,0
"The best of both worlds, caramel complexion",0
I swear when she smiled I almost got an erection,0
Piercing green eyes that shine like emeralds,1
"Once she gave me the wink, could only think with my genitals",0
She tells me her name as soon as I approach her,0
"It's Charmaine, Charmaine De La Rosa",0
I say is that Spanish? She says yeah I say kosher,1
Whole time I'm imaginin' what it'd be like to dose her,1
Train pulls up and we get on it together,0
Duration of the journey get to know each other better,0
We exchange numbers and agree to meet afterwards,0
She blows me a kiss and with that we parted,0
[Chorus],0
"Young girl, get out of my mind",1
"My love for you, is way out of line",1
"Young girl, get out of my mind",1
"My love for you, is way out of line",1
[Verse 2],0
One week and Â£20 phone credit later,1
I don't just wanna juice this girl now I wanna date her,1
She's got a great personality and sense of humour,1
Next time we meet it just can't come any sooner,0
We arrange to go out for a drink at a bar,0
She's already there when I arrive and she looks the part,0
"Even more stunning than I remembered, fuckin' drop dead gorgeous",1
Her ass is tight and her breasts are bloody enormous!,1
Hand in hand we walk over to the doorman,0
He's got a big shiny head he looks like George Foreman,1
He lets her through and asks me for I.D,1
"I'm like what the hell you talkin' 'bout man, I'm 19?!",1
I whip my driver's license out and he lets me in,0
"Then I trip over a step, how embarassin'",0
Charmaine witnesses it all but pretends not to see,0
"I feel like a fool, she just thinks it's sweet...",0
[Chorus],0
"Young girl, get out of my mind",1
"My love for you, is way out of line",1
"Young girl, get out of my mind",1
"My love for you, is way out of line",1
[Verse 3],0
The night goes a lot smoother than planned,0
Apart from the little hiccup at the start it's all gone grand,0
Whenever guys try and,0
chirp,1
she shows 'em the hand,0
Turns down every dance sayin' I'm her man,1
We get a cab back to my place where we get it on,1
"I take off my shirt, she strips right down to the thong",1
"I marvel at her body, voluptuous curves",1
"She's a real woman, no doubt about it, her",1
"Confidence is sky high, she's the one that's got",1
"Me on my back she's sayin' baby, this is your night",1
"I'm like alright, it's worth a go I s'pose",0
So we switch roles and she takes full control,0
"She starts slow, grindin' me softly",0
"Whilst kissin', yeah, she's doin' me properly",0
"Just when I start thinkin' man, this girl's gotta be",0
From outta this world or somethin' because she's shockin' me,0
"Never felt like this before, this was more than sex",0
Sex was somethin' that you had with,0
skets,1
Somethin' the next day you regret,1
With a girl you wish you'd never met,1
"Nuh-uh, no way man, this had to be love",0
"I couldn't believe I was sayin' it, but that's what it was",0
"Like a leaf in the autumn, I had fallen",0
After that nothin' else seemed important,0
[Hook],0
[Verse 4],0
"So now it's time to hear my predicament, my catch 22",1
I love this girl but now I have to cut her loose,1
I was talkin' to one of my boys the very next day,1
And I told him all about me and Charmaine,1
He looks at me in a very strange way,1
And asks me if De La Rosa is her surname,1
If she's mixed race and her eyes are green,1
"I say yeah, he replies blud...",1
That girl's 14...,1
