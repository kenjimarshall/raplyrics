[Intro],0
"Thank you, thank you, thank you!",0
You're far too kind,0
[Chorus],1
"Now, can I get an encore? Do you want more?",0
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy,0
So for one last time I need y'all to roar,0
Now what the hell are you waitin' for?,0
"After me, there shall be no more",0
"So for one last time, nigga, make some noise!",0
[Verse 1],0
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that,0
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at,0
Can't none of y'all mirror me back,0
"Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G Rap in his prime",1
"I'm Young H-O, rap's Grateful Dead",1
"Back to take over the globe, now break bread",1
"I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express",1
"Out the country, but the blueberry still connect",1
"On the low, but the yacht got a triple deck",0
"But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep",0
"Grand openin', grand closin'",1
"Goddamn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again",0
Who you gon' find doper than him?,1
"With no pen, just draw off inspiration",1
Soon you gonna see you can't replace him,1
With cheap imitations for these generations,1
[Chorus],1
"Now, can I get an encore? Do you want more?",0
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy,0
So for one last time I need y'all to roar,0
Now what the hell are you waitin' for?,0
"After me, there shall be no more",0
"So for one last time, nigga, make some noise!",0
[Verse 2],0
(*Sighs*) Look what you made me do! Look what I made for you!,0
"Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you",0
"When you first come in the game, they try to play you",0
"Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you",0
From Marcy to Madison Square,1
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah),0
"As fate would have it, Jay's status appears",1
"To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye",1
When I come back like Jordan,1
"Wearin' the 4-5, it ain't to play games with you",1
"It's to aim at you, probably maim you",1
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens,1
"Cocksucker, take one for your team!",0
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing),1
"I came, I saw, I conquered",1
From record sales to sold-out concerts,1
"So, motherfucker, if you want this encore",1
I need you to scream 'til your lungs get sore,1
[Interlude],0
"Owww, it's star time",0
"This man is mean, he's killin' all y'all jive turkeys",0
Do y'all want more of the Jigga man?,0
"Well, if y'all want more of the Jigga man",0
Then I need y'all to help me bring him back to stage,0
"Say ""Hova!"" – c'mon, say it!",0
"Are y'all out there? [crowd chants ""HO-VA! HO-VA!""]",0
"C'mon, louder!",0
"Yeah, now see that's what I'm talking about",0
"They love you, Jigga! They love you, Jigga!",0
[Break],0
I like the way this one feel,0
"It's so motherfuckin' soulful, man!",0
"(Whoaaaaaahhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh)",0
Yeah [crowd still chanting] okay,0
[Verse 3],0
So this here is the victory lap,1
"Then I'm leavin', that's how you get me back",1
"After a year of them 16's, it's 1.2",0
"And that's 2.4, and I'm only doin' two",0
"You wanted to gain attention, new dudes",0
"I can get you BET – and TRL, too",0
"You want to be in the public, send your budget",0
"Well, fuck it, I ain't budgin'",0
"Young did it to death, you gotta love it",0
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it,0
Now look at me: all star-studded,0
Golfer above par like I putted,1
All ‘cause the shit I uttered was utterly ridiculous,0
How sick is this?,0
"You want to bang, send Kanye change",0
"Send Just some dust, send Hip a grip",0
Then you gotta spit a little somethin' like this,0
[Outro],0
(What the hell are you waiting forrrr?),0
[piano plays out as crowd cheers loudly],0
