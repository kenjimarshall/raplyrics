"Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her",0
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water,0
"Thought, ""Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs""",0
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said,0
[Chorus: Brian Kelley & Tyler Hubbard],0
Baby you a song,0
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise,0
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle,0
Every little farm town with you,0
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit,1
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it,0
Come on,0
So baby you a song,0
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise,0

"My windows down my seats back, my music up and we ride",0
Her legs up on my dashboard and it's just the way I like,0
"Hey country girl, this country boy, like e'rything about you",0
"Don't change a thing, no way, you stay the same and I got you",0
"I likes all that, all that, head to toe, you all that",0
"Tell ole boy he can call back, send her a text say, ""fall back"" 'cause",0
I can see you got a thing for the fast life,0
"So come on, shawty, let me show you what the fast like",0
"Whipping 'cross the border, Florida into Georgia",0
"Cause, baby, you a song",0
"You make me wanna roll my, roll my, roll my, r-r-r-r-roll",0
