Holla fuck the world with my chest full of smoke,0

"Say Dopehouse Records, Screwston, Texas",0
The diamonds in my emblem is cut like a princess,0
"You can keep the Lexus, cause I got two Benzes",0
I'm in your girlfriends' hot intestines,0

"TV screens, margarita machines with street marines",0
"Got love for the Crips, and Bloods, and Latin Kings",0
If it means anything this for all my G's,0
I'm in jail cause I forgot my fucking ABC's,0
"Another DWI, drunk and fucking high",0

They call me young Thurston Howell the Third,0
And that's my word,0
"I'm a swang, I'm a swerve",0
I'm a park and scrape the curve,0

"I'm a use my three wishes, I'm very superstitious",1
No matter where I go I meet a bunch of horny bitches,0
"Burn a few bridges, feed a few pigeons",0
Fuck em so good they wake up and wash dishes,0
"The food was delicious, bacon, eggs, and biscuits",0
No French kisses and no hippopotamuses,0

As I represent Houston like the damn Whitney,0

They say my bandana breaks the dress code,0
Every fine fucking bitch I see is my ex-hoe,0
I'm hoggin' and I'm doggin' creeping and I'm crawling,0
Believe me this my calling it's time to do you all in,0
"Everybody jump jump, boys trip what what",0
Let my double barrel shotty go barump-pa-pump-pum,0
Slangin slab motor rocks up in no man's land,0
"Burnin off in my ""Smokey and the Bandit"" Trans Am",1
The rope around my neck is just dangling and jangling,0
Sometime I smoke the rain and get wetter than a penguin,0
"Aunt Jemima sipper, hoes like Jack Tripper",0
"Peace to Big Dipper, what the deal my nigga",0
