[Verse One - Andy Samberg],0
Lock eyes from across the room,0
Down my drink while the rhythms boom,0
Take your hand and skip the names,0
No need here for the silly games,0
Make our way through the smoke and crowd,0
The club is the sky and I'm on your cloud,0
Move in close as the lasers fly,0
Our bodies touch and the angels cry,0
Leave this place go back to yours,0
Our lips first touch outside your doors,0
A whole night what we've got in store,0
Whisper in my ear that you want some more,0
And I...,0
[Hook],0
Jizzed in my pants,0
This really never happens you can take my word,0
"I won't apologize, that's just absurd",0
Mainly your fault from the way that you dance,0
"And now I,",0
jizz in my pants,0
Don't tell your friends or I'll say you're a slut,0
"Plus it's your fault, you were rubbing my butt",0
"I'm very sensitive, some would say that's a plus",0
Now I'll go home and change,0
[Verse Two - Jorma Taccone],0
I need a few things from the grocery,0
Do things alone now mostly,0
Left me heart broken not lookin' for love,0
Surprised in my eyes when I looked above,0
The checkout counter and I saw a face,0
"My heart stood still, so did time and space",0
Never felt that I could feel real again,0
"But the look in her eyes said ""I need a friend""",0
She turned to me that's when she said it,0
"Looked me dead in the face, asked ""Cash or Credit?""",0
And I...,0
[Hook],0
Jizzed in my pants,0
"It's perfectly normal, nothing wrong with me",0
But we're going to need a clean up on Aisle 3,0
And now I'm posed in an awkward stance because I,0
jizzed in my pants,0
"To be fair, you were flirting a lot",0
Plus the way you bag cans got me bothered and hot,0
Please stop acting like you're not impressed,0
"One more thing, I'm gonna pay by check",0
[Verse Three - Andy and,0
Jorma,0

Last week - I saw a film,0
As I recall it was a horror film,0
Walked outside into the rain,0
Checked my phone and saw you rang and I,0
jizzed in my pants,0
"Speeding down the street when the red lights flash
Need to get away need to make a dash
A song comes on that reminds me of you and I jizz in my pants",0
The next day my alarm goes off and I,0
jizz in my pants,0
Open my window and a breeze rolls in and I jizz in my pants,0
When Bruce Willis was dead at the end of Sixth Sense,1
I,0
jizzed in my pants,0
I just ate a grape and I jizzed in my pants,0
I went-,0
Jizzed in my pants,0
(Okay seriously you guys can we... okay?),0
[Bridge - Andy and Jorma],0
I jizz right in my pants everytime you're next to me,0
"And when we're holdin' hands, it's like having sex to me",0
"You say I'm premature, I just call it ecstasy",0
"I wear a rubber at all times, it's a necessity",0
Cause I jizz in my pants,0
[Outro],0
"I jizz in my pants, I jizz in my pants",0
"Yes I jizz in my pants, yes I jizz in my pants",0
Yes I jizz in my pants,0
"I jizz in my pants, I jizz in my pants",0
