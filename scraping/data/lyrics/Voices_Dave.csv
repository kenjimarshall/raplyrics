I gotta speak out,0
"I know heartbreak well, man, I got her on speed dial",0
Me and suffering got the same dad,0
Me and pain go way back,0
And it's hard to explain but,0

"All my life, I hear voices",0
"All my life, I hear voices when I sleep",0
"All my life, I hear voices",0
And the voices,0
They say you’re everything that I need,0

"Look, I don't wanna waste time",0
But heartache's my G I can get her on FaceTime (Right now),0

"I don't know envy, that nigga lives on the other side",0

"Used to sit down in a room all day and think to myself, ""What the fuck am I doing wrong?""",0
"Sorrow's a bitch, I'm glad that she left, I'm moving on",0
Never had no pot to piss in,0
Made so many wrong decisions,0
'Til I fell in love with optimism,0
"And our love, it's like the sweetest thing",0
Man grew up 'round sweets and cling,0
Now we pull up to the club with the sweetest tings,0
I can’t even play with the ting if she ain't 19 on a FIFA ting,1
"I don’t care what beef mans in, can't pull up 'round here on a idiot ting 'cause-",0

"All my life, I hear voices",0
"All my life, I hear voices when I sleep",0
"All my life, I hear voices",0
And the voices,0
They say you’re everything that I need,0
[Post-Chorus],0
I can't get 'em out,0
I can't get 'em out my head,0
I can't get 'em out,0
