"Baby you send me, baby you send me",0
Set adrift on memory bliss of you,0
[Verse 1],0
The camera pans the cocktail glass,1
Behind a blind of plastic plants,1
I found the lady with the fat diamond ring,1
Then you know I can't remember a damn thing,1
I think it's one of those déjà vu things,0
Or a dream that's tryin' to tell me somethin',0
Or will I ever stop thinkin' about it,0
"I don't know, I doubt it",0
Subterranean by design,1
I wonder what I would find,0
"If I met you, let my eyes caress you",0
Until I meet the thought of Mrs Princess Who?,0
I often wonder what makes her work,0
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts,0
Assuming that there are some out there,0
"They're probably alone, solitaire",1
I can remember when,0
I caught up with a past-time intimate friend,0
"She said, bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely",0
But you probably don't think nothin' of me,0
"She was right, though, I can't lie",0
She's just one of those corners in my mind,0
And I just put her right back with the rest,0
"That's the way it goes, I guess",0

[Verse 2],0
A careless whisper from a careless man,1
A neutron dance for a neutron fan,1
Marionette strings are dangerous things,1
I thought of all the trouble they bring,1
"An eye for an eye, a spy for spy",1
Rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh,0
Tell me that she's not dreaming,0
"She's got an ace in the hole, it doesn't have meaning",0
Reality used to be a friend of mine,1
"Cause complete control, I don't take too kind",0
"Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on",0
And guess whose piece of the cake is Jack gone?,0
She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign,0
I told her whispers in my heart were fine,0
What did she think she could do?,0
"I feel for her, I really do",0
And I stared at the ring finger on her hand,0
I wanted her to be a big PM Dawn fan,0
But I had to put her right back with the rest,0
"That's the way it goes, I guess",0
