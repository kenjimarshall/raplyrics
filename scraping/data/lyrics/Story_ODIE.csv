[Verse 1],0
I was,0
Born living under the hope and a rock,0
But I,0
Know niggas that are glow in the dark,0
I can't wait still I'm sitting on more racks,0
"Cause all I ever wanted was Kodak, moments",0
But I,0
Don't listen now stuck in a rut,0
In my own prison wanna open the lock,0
I ain't praying enough and I know,0
I got eyes in the back of my soul,0
Telling me to wait and see,0
Fall to my knees,0
And let the rhythm come like it's naturally,0
But every time I wanna lead,0
I can't believe,0
That I could ever run to the harmony,0
Just like a wave that flow through the sea,0
Searching for days just show me the way,0
I'll be up late working all night,0
Don't hesitate we'll be all right,0
"(yuh, yuh, yeah)",0
[Chorus],0
Cause I've been tryna find the words for my story,0
So don't wait for a nigga,0
Just pray for a nigga my love,0
"(yuh, yuh, yeah)",0
It'll all be right in the morning,0
So hold faith for a little,0
Don't play with your peace of mind,0
[Verse 2],0
And everywhere I go,0
I can't erase my home,0
Cause I know even if I don't call back,0
My loves keep me up when I fall back,0
Help me like I'm,0
Too tired to fill my role,0
Regenerate my wounds,0
And I owe them a piece of my whole,0
Cause I can't do it all on my own,0
You see my mama and my papa,0
Work too hard to see me suffer,0
In the presence of another,0
So I'll never let them down oh no I won't,0
"(no I won't, no I won't)",0
And you can bet it on my soul,0
"So the voice in my mind go ""pop it, pop it""",0
The words and the rhythm won't stop it,0
"And even if they do, yeah",0
I'll tell em this is what I wrote,0
"Oh woah oh (yuh, yuh, yeah)",0
[Chorus],0
Cause I've been tryna find the words for my story,0
So don't wait for a nigga,0
Just pray for a nigga my love,0
"(yuh, yuh, yeah)",0
It'll all be right in the morning,0
So hold faith for a little,0
Don't play with your peace of mind,0
[Chorus],0
Cause I've been tryna find the words for my story,0
So don't wait for a nigga,0
Just pray for a nigga my love,0
"(yuh, yuh, yeah)",0
It'll all be right in the morning,0
So hold faith for a little,0
Don't play with your peace of mind,0
[Outro],0
"You can be somebody, my love",0
"Aw yeah, let's write your story",0
Just believe in something my love,0
"Aw yeah, don't wait till morning",0
