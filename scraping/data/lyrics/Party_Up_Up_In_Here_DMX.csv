Or you gon' find yourself buried next to someone else,0
And we all thought you loved yourself,1
But that couldn't have been the issue,1
Or maybe they just saying that now ‘cause they miss you,1
"Shit, a nigga tried to diss you",1

Looking at the roof of the church,1
Preacher telling the truth and it hurts,1
