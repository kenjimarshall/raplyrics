On and on about my twitter notifications I give these hoes too much attention,0
"Damn, girl you got me fucked up",0
I just wished that you would understand,0

I don't know it's worth the fight,0
"Still tryna comprehend how we manage to argue, fuck all in the same night",0
Buy you all the shit that you like,0
But you say fuck that you want my time,0
My time tight but my bag right so it's like I try to compromise,0
Ain't with talking but you know what's up,0

But at the same time the other part of me wanna cave in and hit you up,0
That's why I'm so worried about this hoe,0

"Why you still calling if you ain't let me talk, leave me the fuck alone",0
"First it's fuck me, then it's fuck you then you love me and I love you you worried bout these hoes and what lust do you can't trust me I can't trust you",0
