Girl you cut up (Lucius Left Foot),0
Girl you know you cut up,0
[Hook: Sleepy Brown & Jazze Pha],0
Crocodile on my feet,1
Fox fur on my back,1
Bowtie 'round my neck,1
That's why they call me the gangsta mack,1
"In the Cadillac, yeah",1
Crocodile on my feet,1
Fox fur on my back,1
Bowtie 'round my neck,1
That's why they call me the gangsta mack,1

[Verse 1: Big Boi],0
"Nasty Noompsy Knightingale, fresh in that tuxedo",0
"Cummerbund with no suspenders, my torpedo, you libido",0
Need to chat,0
"(Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)",1
"I'm your r-o-l-a-i-d-s, release the squeeze",1
or release the keys,0
"To the shackles on her wrist, she can tackle some of this",0
Smack on smack on some of this Dick Tracy,1
"Arrest her, book her, fingerprint your hooker",0
You took her to the club and now her body is full of liquor,0
Off that Butterscotch Schnapps and Bailey's Irish Cream,1
She's a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things,0
"Whatcha mean? (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)",0
"In the parking lot we primp, crooked booty to the scene where I",0

[Verse 2: Big Boi],0
"Oh, lord, how can it be so hard?",0
To put on a pair of panties much less a pair of jeans or the leotard,0
But I got to start by complimenting you on your physique,0
"You unique, you best believe I'm gon' skeet once I speak",0
"Spoke, spit, spatter, spat and I macked her just like that",0
But it takes years of perseverance and experience to get that cat,0
So why don't I chase this Hennessy down with some of that,0
"On your back, like a cheerleader missing the final stack",0
"As we strut, skip the line through the glass window, glance",0
"We look fine, right on time as we step in the place",0
"The nursery's crunk, we've come to play",0
[Verse 3: Sleepy Brown],0
Everybody's watching cause them furs just hit the door,0
"While the gator's creeping, crawling, oh so wicked across that floor",0
To the V.I.P. where we proceed to give you what you need,0
Throw your hands up if you feel me,0
Throw your hands up if you feel me,0
"'Cause we well designed, like the finest wine",0
"Feel good to be fly, so don't you ask me why",0
"I got the ladies in line, because they can't deny",0
"So raise your hands to the sky, 'cause we super fly",0
