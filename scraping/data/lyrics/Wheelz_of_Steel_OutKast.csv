"Uh,",0

Once upon a time not long ago,1
When the playa from the Point didn't have no flow,1
"A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walking to the store",1
"Caught a playa slipping, but now I lay it to the flo'",1
Just like carpet,1

'cause I got the heat in my baby,1
Momma name now,1
",",0
never bragging just to stay knot,1
"Even when I was a younger lad, I learned my lesson;",1
Never talked to strangers in the trap and answer questions,1
The Pope and his folks got us under a scope,1
But for unknown reasons cause we don't sell dope,1
"
That you distribute, we don't contribute to your clandestine
Activity, my soliloquy may be hard for some to swallow
But so is cod liver oil
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl
Two things I hate—liars and thieves; they make my blood boil
Boa constricted, on my soul that they coil",0

It took your momma nine months to make it,1
But it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it,1
"Cut that kronk clean up, I did, but I did so not safely",1
"Don't want no AIDS, *clapping* no claps, or no rabies",1
"Yeah, we take no shit, like, ummm, stopped up commodes",1
"
Gotta collect call, they done locked up my folks
Low blow, hit me in the left ventricle
We won't be able to ride out till two thousand four",0
But not for long 'cause we got a better sack to serve,1
Tryna take you other people 'fore your rims at the curb,0
"'Fore you swerve and bust ya forehead, go 'head, go 'head",0
"More head for me, while you ride to the beat",0
"Drop, like tears, like For Fears, you know",1
"Shout, shout, let it all out, just for my peers",1
"
And peoples who feel it's time to unwind
Like December 31st, on nineteen-ninety-nine",0

"Okay, like this, yes, yes",1
One time for my boys doing King shit,1
"Two times, too legit and it don't quit",1
Three times for my folks in the drop top,1
"Four times, OutKast and it don't stop",0
One time for my girls doing Queen thangs,1
"Dead fresh to the T, eating chicken wings",1
Three times for my girls in the beauty shop,0
"Four times, OutKast and it don't stop",0
