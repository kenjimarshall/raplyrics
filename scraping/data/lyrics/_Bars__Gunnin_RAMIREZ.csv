[Verse: RAMIREZ],0
"Bitch I'm on a mission, my destination the grave",0
Aim my chopper to yo' head then I take off your toup√©e,0
"Mobbin' fo' deep inside of a bucket, the transmission slippin'",0
"Had a conversation with the devil, told me get to rippin'",0
"It's the Grey 59, Throw your six up in the air",0
"Darkness falling from above, Step across and bitch beware",0
I'd rather die from my feet than to live upon my knees,1
"True soldier from the trenches, jumpin' out the 7 seas",0
Fuck with me get your wig pulled back,0
"Steady swervin' off a Xanax, that I put inside the shack",0
This shit is kickin' in and I just don't know how to act,0
My remembrance is enough bout to pull a hijack,0
"Crash a plane inside of a buildin', now watch the bodies burn",0
"As the world turns, police service coming' but I'm not concerned",0
"Suicide, I'll lay my ashes inside of a gold urn",0
Shootin' at these busters so you know murder is what I yearn,0
"Get a call it from my uncle, tells me nephew what you doin'",0
"Come to M-town, we can get some money and pick up you",0
"Ball 'til the day I fall,",0
hundred ghost walks when I crawl,1
Keep my back along the wall,0
Watch another pussy fall,0
"Mind fucked up,",0
keep the toolie like I'm Bobby mane,1
In the kitchen whippin' up a storm and standin' in the rain,0
5*9 plug till my body turns grey,0
Till you put me in the dirt and leave my body to decay,0
"Run up, bitch you don't wanna",0
"I keep my gun up, 'till the sun up",0
We on the come up,0
I push this gat into yo stomach,0
Bitch I'm the gunna,0
You think you ballin',0
You no stunna 'cause imma hunna,0
This is a stick-up,0
I get down when I come around a mask over my face,0
"Buckin' at the window, drive-by bitches give me space",0
I don't need to talk to nobody 'cus all you suckas fake,0
"Bitch you mad about the fact, that your music don't make plays",0
"Sellin' reposts yous a hoe, I need 10 to spit a flow",0
"Twenty bands up at your show, gorilla comin' out the sko",0
Brown paper bagged up St. Ides sippin,0
"Like I said, in the beginning, I'm a killa on a mission",0
Betta back the fuck up 'cus shits about to get real,0
Call upon the fucking devil so him and I cut a deal,0
"Searchin fo' another meal, could give a fuck how you feel",0
"Bitch you fuckin' with the wrong one, I'm 'bout to make you squeal",0
