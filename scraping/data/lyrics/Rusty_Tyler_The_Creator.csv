"""I'm saying, you know, like. All I ever told you to do was grow up, don't grow down. You know, like, you know, grow up. Don't grow down, grow out. You go from being a kid, just doing your thing, hanging out with your friends. Months later you're world famous. You're a gay rights activist, and you don't even know it. You know what, I don't wanna say it to you no more, Tyler. Fuck you, Tyler!""",1

"[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]",0
In a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather,1
"Sitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather",1
"Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether",1
"Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better",1

"See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's",1
And I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell,0
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele,0
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille,1
"I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well",0
"I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself",0

Poppin' like oil ollie in fire flames,1
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game,1
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name,0
About as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes,1
"But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists",1
"God damn menace, 666",1
and he's not finished,0
"And my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens?",0
"See y'all niggas tripping, man",0
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong,1
Saying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs,1
"Look at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me",1
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat,1
Look at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind,1
"But talk is money, I said, ""Hi,"" I guess I bought him some time",1
"Look at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?",1
"They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?",1
"But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan",1
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements,1
"And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing",0

"""Analog"" fans are getting sick of the rape",1
"All the ""Tron Cat"" fans are getting sick of the lakes",1
"But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints",0
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank,0
"Oh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?",0
"My fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct",0
"Fuck buying studio time, I'ma go ",1

"(Why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)",0
"All Iâ€™m seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me",1
"That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff",1
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot),1
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids,1

"Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and",1
"All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!)",1
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs,1
