[Hook 1: Wonder Mike],1
I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie,1
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop,1
The rock it to the bang bang boogie,1
"Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat",1
[Verse 1: Wonder Mike],0
"Now, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat",1
"And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet",0
"See I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say ""hello""",0
"To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow",1
"But first, I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie",1
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie,1
"Let's rock, you don't stop",1
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock,0
"Well so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along",0
"And next on the mic is my man Hank; come on, Hank, sing that song",0
[Verse 2: Big Bank Hank],0
"Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-AN, the O-V-A and the rest is F-L-Y",1
"You see, I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons I'll tell you why",1
You see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun and I dress to a tee,1
You see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously,0
"I got bodyguards, I got two big cars, that definitely ain't the whack",0
I got a Lincoln continental and a sunroof Cadillac,0
"So after school, I take a dip in the pool, which is really on the wall",1
I got a color TV so I can see,1
the Knicks,1
play basketball,1
"Hear me talking 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money than a sucker could ever spend",0
"But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker, not a dime 'til I made it again",1
[Hook 2: Big Bank Hank],0
"Everybody go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today (say what?)",1
"Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ",1
"Everybody go: Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn",0
"You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend",0
[Post-Hook: Big Bank Hank],0
"Uh Master Gee, my mellow?",0
It's on you so what you gonna do?,0
[Verse 3: Master Gee],0
"Well it's on and on and on, on and on",1
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn,0
"I said M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E",0
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee,0
"Well, my name is known all over the world",0
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls,0
I'm going down in history,1
As the baddest rapper there ever could be,1
Now I'm feeling the highs and you're feeling the lows,1
The beat starts getting into your toes,0
You start popping your fingers and stomping your feet,0
And moving your body while you're sitting in your seat,0
"And then damn, you start doing the freak",1
"I said damn, right outta your seat",1
Then you throw your hands high in the air,1
"You're rocking to the rhythm, shake your derriere",1
You're rocking to the beat without a care,0
With the sure-shot emcees for the affair,0
"Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang",0
But I rap to the beat just the same,0
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes,0
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize,0
"Singing on and on and on, on and on",0
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn,0
"Singing on and on and on, on and on",0
Like a hot ready to pop the pop the pop dibbie dibbie,0
"Pop the pop, pop, you don't dare stop",0
Come alive y'all gimme what you got,0
I guess by now you can take a hunch,1
And find that I am the baby of the bunch,1
"But that's okay, I still keep in stride",0
Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind,1
"Singing on and on and on, on and on",0
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn,0
"Singing on and on and on, on and on",0
Rock rock y'all get on the floor,0
[Hook 3: Master Gee],0
I'm gonna freak ya here I'm gonna freak you there,0
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere,0
[Post-Hook: Master Gee],0
Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind,0
I'll put t-t-tickets in your behind,1
"I said 1-2-3-4, come on, girls, get on the floor",0
"Uh, come alive, y'all gimme what ya got",0
Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock,0
"I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike what are you waiting for?",0
[Hook 1: Wonder Mike],1
I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie,1
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop,1
The rock it to the bang bang boogie,1
"Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat",1
[Verse 4: Wonder Mike],0
Skiddlee beebop a we rock a scooby doo,0
"And guess what, America: we love you",0
Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul,0
You could rock 'til you're a hundred and one years old,0
I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast,0
But we like hot butter on a breakfast toast,0
"Rock it up, uh, baby bubbah",0
Baby bubbah to the boogie the bang bang the boogie,0
"To the beat beat, it's so unique",0
"Come on, everybody, and dance to the beat",0
[Bridge: Intro sound: 16 measures],0
[Hook 1: Wonder Mike],1
I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie,1
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop,1
The rock it to the bang bang boogie,1
"Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat",1
[Verse 5: Wonder Mike],0
I said I can't wait 'til the end of the week,0
When I'm rapping to the rhythm of a groovy beat,0
An attempt to raise your body heat,0
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak,0
To do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet,0
And let it change up to a dance called the freak,1
And when ya finally do come into your rhythmic beat,0
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak,0
I know a man named Hank,1
He has more rhymes than a serious bank,1
"So come on Hank, uh, sing that song",1
To the rhythm of the boogie the bang bang the bong,1
[Verse 6: Big Bank Hank],0
"Well, I'm Imp the Dimp the ladies pimp",1
The women fight for my delight,1
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs,1
That shock the house for the young ladies,0
"And when you come inside, into the front",0
"You do the freak, spank, and do the bump",0
And when the sucker emcees try to prove a point,0
"We're treacherous trio, uh, with a serious joint",0
A from sun to sun and from day to day,0
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme,0
Because they say that miracles never cease,0
I've created a devastating masterpiece,1
I'm gonna rock the mic til you can't resist,0
"Everybody, I say it goes like this",0
Well I was coming home late one dark afternoon,0
Reporter stopped me for a interview,0
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables,0
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables,0
This young reporter I did adore,1
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before,1
"She said ""damn fly guy I'm in love with you""",1
The Casanova legend must have been true,1
I said by the way baby what's your name,0
"Said ""I go by the name of Lois Lane""",1
And you could be my boyfriend you surely can,0
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman,0
I said he's a fairy I do suppose,1
Flying through the air in pantyhose,1
He may be very sexy or even cute,0
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit,0
I said you need a man who's got finesse,0
And his whole name across his chest,0
He may be able to fly all through the night,0
But can he rock a party 'til the early light,0
He can't satisfy you with his little worm,0
But I can bust you out with my super sperm,1
"I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it",1
"An I'm here and I'm there I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere",0
Just throw your hands up in the air,1
And party hardy like you just don't care,1
"Let's do it, uh, don't stop y'all, uh, tick a tock y'all you don't stop",0
[Hook 2: Big Bank Hank],0
"I go: Hotel, motel, what you gonna do today (say what)",1
I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ,1
"Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn",1
"You see, if your girl starts acting up then you take her friend",0
[Post-Hook: Big Bank Hank],0
"I say skip, dive, what can I say",0
I can't fit em all inside my OJ,0
So I just take half and bust them out,0
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house,0
[Verse 7: Master Gee],0
It was 12 o'clock one Friday night,0
I was rocking to the beat and feeling all right,0
Everybody was dancing on the floor,0
Doing all the things they never did before,0
And then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean,0
"She came into the bar, she came into the scene",0
As she traveled deeper inside the room,0
All the fellas checked out her white Sassons,0
"She came up to the table, looked into my eyes",0
Then she turned around and shook her behind,0
"So I said to myself, its time for me to release",0
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece,0
And now people in the house this is just for you,0
A little rap to make you boogaloo,1
Now the group ya hear is called Phase Two,0
And let me tell ya something we're a hell of a crew,0
Once a week we're on the street,0
Just a-cutting the jams and making it free,0
"For you to party, got to have the moves",0
So we'll get right down and give you a groove,0
For you to dance you got to be hype,0
So we'll get right down for you tonight,0
Now the system's on and the girls are there,0
You definitely have a rocking affair,0
But let me tell ya something there's still one fact,0
That to have a party ya got to have a rap,0
"So when the party's over, you're making it home",0
And trying to sleep before the break of dawn,0
And while ya sleeping you start to dream,0
And thinking how ya danced on the disco scene,0
A name appears in your mind,0
"Yeah, a name you know that was right on time",0
It was phase two just a doing a do,0
Rocking ya down cause ya know we could,0
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak,0
Come alive girls get on your feet,0
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat,0
To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak,0
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on,0
On and on into the break of dawn,0
Now I got a man coming on right now,0
He's guaranteed to throw down,0
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike,0
Come on Wonder Mike do what ya like,0
[Verse 8: Wonder Mike],1
Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,0
Like a millionaire that has no money,0
Like a rainy day that is not wet,0
Like a gambling fiend that does not bet,0
Like Dracula without his fangs,0
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang,0
Like collard greens that don't taste good,0
Like a tree that's not made out of wood,0
Like going up and not coming down,0
"Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound",0
"To the beat beat, ya do the freak",0
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat,0
Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat,1
And the food just ain't no good,0
I mean the macaroni's soggy the peas are mushed,0
And the chicken tastes like wood,0
So you try to play it off like you think you can,1
By saying that you're full,1
"And then your friend says ""momma he's just being polite",1
"He ain't finished uh-uh that's bull""",0
So your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie,0
And you say that you already ate,0
"And your friend says ""man there's plenty of food""",0
So you pile some more on your plate,0
While the stinky food's steaming your mind starts to dreaming,0
Of the moment that it's time to leave,0
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting,0
Into something that looks like cheese,0
Oh so you say that's it I got to leave this place,0
I don't care what these people think,0
I'm just sitting here making myself nauseous,0
With this ugly food that stinks,0
So you bust out the door while its still closed,0
Still sick from the food you ate,0
And then you run to the store for quick relief,0
From a bottle of kaopectate,0
And then you call your friend two weeks later,0
To see how he has been,0
"And he says ""I understand about the food",0
"Baby but bubbah we're still friends""",0
[Hook 1: Wonder Mike],1
With a hip hop the hippie the hippie,1
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop,1
The rock it to the bang bang boogie,1
"Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat",1
[Post-Hook: Wonder Mike],0
"I say ""Hank can ya rock?",0
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?,0
"Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo""",0
"I said ""come on, make uh, make the people move""",0
[Verse 9: Big Bank Hank],0
I go to the halls and then ring the bell,0
Because I am the man with the clientele,0
And if ya ask me why I rock so well,0
"I'm Big Bank, I got clientele",0
And from the time I was only six years old,0
I never forgot what I was told,0
It was the best advice that I ever had,0
It came from my wise dear old dad,0
"He said ""sit down punk I wanna talk to you",0
And don't say a word until I'm through,0
Now there's a time to laugh a time to cry,1
A time to live and a time to die,1
A time to break and a time to chill,1
To act civilized or act real ill,1
But whatever ya do in your lifetime,0
"Ya never let a MC steal your rhyme""",1
So from six to six 'til this very day,0
Ill always remember what he had to say,0
So when the sucker emcees try to chump my style,0
I let them know that I'm versatile,0
"I got style, finesse and a little black book",1
That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look,0
But there's a thing that separates you from me,0
And that is called originality,0
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard,0
I didn't even bite and not a godd--m word,0
And I say a little more later on tonight,0
So the sucker emcees can bite all night,0
"Uh, tick a tock y'all, a beat, beat y'all",0
"A lets rock y'all, ya don't stop",0
[Hook 2: Big Bank Hank],0
"It go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today (say what)",1
Cause I'ma get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ,0
"Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn",1
You see if your girl starts acting up then you take her friends,1
[Post-Hook: Big Bank Hank],0
A like that y'all to the beat y'all,0
"A beat, beat y'all ya don't stop",0
"Uh, Master Gee am I mellow?",0
Its on you so whatcha gonna do?,0
[Verse 10: Master Gee],0
Well like Johnny Carson on the late show,1
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo,1
Well like the  Bar-Kays singing 'Holy Ghost',1
The sounds to throw down they're played the most,0
Just like my man Captain Sky,1
Whose name he earned with his super sperm,1
We rock and we don't stop,0
Get off y'all I'm here to give you whatcha got,0
To the beat that it makes you freak,0
"And come alive girl, uh, get on your feet",0
A like a Perry Mason without a case,1
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face,1
Like the barkays on the mic,1
Like getting right down for you tonight,0
Like moving your body so ya don't know how,0
Right to the rhythm and throw down,0
Like coming alive to the Master Gee,0
The brother who rocks so viciously,0
I said the age of one my life begun,0
At the age of two I was doing the do,0
At the age of three it was you and me,0
Rocking to the sounds of the Master Gee,0
At the age of four I was on the floor,0
Giving all the freaks what they bargained for,0
At the age of five I didn't take no jive,0
With the Master Gee its all the way live,0
"At the age of six I was uh, picking up sticks",0
Rapping to the beat my stick was fixed,0
At the age of seven I was rocking in heaven,0
Dontcha know I went off,0
I got right on down to the beat you see,0
Getting right on down making all the girls,0
Just take of their clothes to the beat the beat,0
"To the double beat, beat that makes you freak",0
"At the age of eight I was, uh,  really great",0
Cause every night you see I had a date,0
"At the age of nine I was, uh, right on time",0
Cause every night I had a part to rhyme,0
"Going on and on and on, on and on",0
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn,0
"A saying on and on and on, on and on",0
Like a hot buttered the pop the pop the popcorn,0
A saying on and on and on on and on,0
Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic,0
I am the definite feast delight,0
I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic,0
I am the definite feast delight,0
Call me the master gee you see,0
The brother who rocks so viciously,0
[Hook 3: Master Gee],0
I'm gonna freak ya here I'm gonna freak ya there,0
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere,0
[Outro: Master Gee],0
".....The east to the west, I rock you the best....",0
