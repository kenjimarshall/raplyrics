[Intro: Darnell Boat],1
"Ohhh Boy, where do I start",1
Darnelle Boat here checking in once again,1
I just wanna tell y'all,1
I am so so thankful and appreciative for everyone who has been supporting my nephews,1
Yachty and boat have been working so hard over this past year and we just want to welcome y'all to Teenage Emotions,1
Well they both have lots to say they've been working really hard,1
I think this time Yachty wants to go first,1
[Verse 1],0
I done did a lot this year,1
"Made a lot of friends, some came, some go",0
And I still never took a sip of beer,1
Still fuck hoes by the pier,0
Still ride around without a roof,0
Still ride around with k$upreme sippin goop,1
And my managers know lots and lots of goons,0
So let me know if there's pressure in the room,0
[Chorus],0
I'd rather do it than say,0
And I done did it all before,0
I done had sex with six different whores,0
At the same time on they grandmother's back porch,0
"Yeah, I'd rather do it than say",0
And I done did it all before,0
I done rode around in a brand new Porsche,0
And I switched it up to the Bentley with two doors,0
I'ma live life like a star,0
I'ma live life like a star,0
I'ma live life like a star,0
I'ma live life like a star,0
[Verse 2],0
I used to wanna be rich,1
Now Lil Boat on the Forbes list,1
And my mom walk around with a frozen wrist,1
And my sister walk around with the nicest kicks,1
I used to wanna go far,0
Now a nigga up in the galaxy,0
Tryna figure out why these niggas mad at me,0
"Sending shots while I'm livin' so lovely, like a star",0
[Chorus],0
I'd rather do it than say,0
And I done did it all before,0
I done rode around in a brand new Porsche,1
And I switched it up to the Bentley with two doors,1
I'ma live life like a star,0
I'ma live life like a star,0
I'ma live life like a star,0
I'ma live life like a star,0
[Bridge],0
"Look mama, you made a star",0
"Look mama, you made a star",0
"Look mama, you made a star",0
"Look mama, you made a star",0
I'm a star,0
"Look mama, you made a star",0
"Look mama, you made a star",0
"Look mama, you made a star",0
[Outro: Darnelle Boat],1
He's such a showoff,0
"Man, I can't even talk, Boat's more of a showoff",0
"Speakin' of Boat, I think right now he's with Digital Nas",1
Let's go over there,1
