[Verse 1: DMX],0
Once again it's the darker nigga,1
"Hit or spark a nigga, break apart a nigga",0
"But the dog is bigger, under stress",0
So unless you're wanting to bless to the chest,1
These slugs from the Smith & Wess rest,1
Or the pump'll put a hurt on a nigga,0
Dump six motherfuckin feet of dirt on a nigga,1
"My hands stay dirty, 'cause I play dirty the mob way",0
"You don't know, fuck it find out the hard",0
A nigga's job is never done,0
I handle my business how it come,0
And there's never been a one on one,0
"There hasn't been a problem, I dissolve em like salt, lock it up",0
Hate to fall but never wreck his car,0
"And it's my fault, keep niggas on point ducking down",0
"Niggas like you need to get bust, you fucking clown",0
I extort to support my peeps,0
"And hold down the fort, never get caught, 'cause I creeps, nigga!",0

"I'm at the crossroads, look but I'm not really sure which way to go",0
Should I play that low for what I did the other day,0
"They on their way to float, got me striking this random",0
I can't stand em fake-ass niggas wanting to be the Phantom,0
"Looking over my shoulder, cause it's colder than it was",1
"And start shorty, because I'm a little older than cuz",0
"And the buzz from the saw, wit the chain to your brain",0
Will turn that big nigga to a fucking stain,0
The pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute,0
But I'm gon die by it 'cause I'm like knee-deep in it,0
And you motherfuckers wonder why I start shit?,0
"'Cause when you look in my face, you see that hard shit!",0
"""Cause I done been to Hell and back I ain't wit selling crack",0
"I'd rather rob a nigga, leave him wit a shell up in his back",0
On the real just to show proof,0
Hit the GWB and blow the whole roof,0
"Off the toll booth, bitch ass nigga!",0

"When I crawl, leave a nigga sprawled out after I spoke em",0
"I'll slit his throat, dick in the mud and let his blood choke em",0
Up north niggas get the pick stuck up in em,1
And in the streets bitches get the dick stuck up in em,1
My M.O. is man-slaughter kid,0
'Cause on the reals I done wet up more motherfuckers than water did,0
"Slid, cause I got to slide when the dirt is done",0
A homicide but they want me on the Murder 1,0
"But as long as I got my gun, I'm aight",0
"Stay outta sight while it's light, and then come out at night",0
"To make moves again, stomp and bruise again",0
"I know I'm going to Hell, 'cause I choose to sin",0
All my motherfucking life I been the Devil's advocate,0
Now niggas never even knew the Devil had a kid,0
But he does; and when you hear the buzz of the chainsaw,0
You'll know why I'll split your motherfucking brains for!,0
