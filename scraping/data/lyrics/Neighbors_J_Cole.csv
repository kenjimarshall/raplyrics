"Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president",1
I just wanna talk to the man,1
Speak for the boys in the bando,1
And my nigga never walkin' again,1
Apologize if I'm harpin' again,1
I know these things happen often,1
But I'm back on the scene,1
I was lost in a dream as I write this,1
The team down in Austin,1
I been buildin' me a house,1
"Back home in the South, ma",1
Won't believe what it's costin',1
"And it's fit for a king, right?",1
Or a nigga that could sing,1
And explain all the pain that it cost him,1
My sixteen should've came with a coffin,1
Fuck the fame and the fortune,1
"Well, maybe not the fortune",1
But one thing is for sure though,1
The fame is exhaustin',1
"That's why I moved away, I needed privacy",1
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League,1
Students that's recruited highly,1
"Thinkin' ""You do you and I do me""",1
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard,1
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars,1
"Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard",1
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star,1
In the driveway there's no rapper cars,1
Just some shit to get from back and forth,1
Just some shit to get from back and forth,1
"Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure",1
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure,1
To be the star you always knew you were,1
"Wait, I think police is at the door",1
[Chorus],0
"Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope",1
"Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope sellin' dope",1
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—,1
"(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)",1
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,1
"(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)",1
"I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope",1
"Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope",1
"Well motherfucker, I am",1
[Verse 2],0
Some things you can't escape:,1
"Death, taxes, and a ra-",1
-cist society that make,1
Every nigga feel like a candidate,1
For a Trayvon kinda fate,1
Even when your crib sit on a lake,1
Even when your plaques hang on a wall,1
Even when the president jam your tape,1
Took a little break just to annotate,1
"How I feel, damn, it's late",1
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid,1
Black in a white man territory,1
Cops bust in with the army guns,1
No evidence of the harm we done,1
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang,1
"Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn",1
[Bridge],0
Don't follow me,1
Don't follow me,1
Don't follow me,1
Don't follow me,1
[Chorus],0

I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,1
"(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)",1
"I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope",1
"Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope",1
"Well motherfucker, I am",1
[Outro],0
"I am, I am, I am, I am",1
"Well, motherfucker, I am",1
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,1
"I am, I am, I am",1
"Well, motherfucker, I am",1
So much for integration,1
Don't know what I was thinkin',1
I'm movin' back to south side,1
So much for integration,1
Don't know what I was thinkin',1
