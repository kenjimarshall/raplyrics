[Intro],0
Break 'em,0
Yeah,0
Yeah,0
Yeah,0
Uh,0
[Verse 1],1
"Just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank God",0
"I don't know, but today seems kinda odd",0
"No barking from the dog, no smog",1
And Momma cooked a breakfast with no hog,1
"I got my grub on, but didn't pig out",1
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out,0
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door,0
"Thinkin', ""Will I live another 24?""",1
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top,0
"And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop",0
Had to stop at a red light,0
Lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight,0
And everything is alright,0
"I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night",1
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all,0
"""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""",0
Get me on the court and I'm trouble,0
"Last week, fucked around and got a triple double",1
"Freakin' niggas every way, like MJ",1
I can't believe today was a good day,0
[Verse 2],0
Drove to the pad and hit the showers,0
Didn't even get no static from the cowards,0
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me,0
Saw the police and they rolled right past me,0
"No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction",0
As I ran the intersection,0
"Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps",1
What's the haps on the craps?,1
"Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em",1
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas,1
"And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11",1
"7, even back door Lil Joe",0
I picked up the cash flow,0
"Then we played bones, and I'm yellin': ""Domino!""",1
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA,1
Today was a good day,1
[Verse 3],0
Left my nigga's house paid,0
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade,0
"It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic",0
The Lakers beat the Supersonics,1
I felt on the big fat fanny,0
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani,0
"And my dick runs deep, so deep",0
So deep put her ass to sleep,0
Woke her up around one,1
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun,1
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin',0
"Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion",0
I was glad everything had worked out,0
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out,1
Today was like one of those fly dreams,0
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams,1
No helicopter lookin' for a murder,1
"Two in the morning, got the Fatburger",0
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp,1
"And it read ""Ice Cube's a Pimp""",1
(Yeah),0
"Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up",0
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up,0
Today I didn't even have to use my AK,1
"I gotta say, it was a good day",0
[Outro],0
"Hey, wait, wait a minute!",1
"Pooh, stop this shit!",1
What the fuck am I thinkin' about?,1
