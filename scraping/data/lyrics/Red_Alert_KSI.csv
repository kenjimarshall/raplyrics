Zeeshan,1
[Verse 1: KSI],0
Now she wanna call me asking favours,1
"Still, I'm on the hunt for different flavours",1
While my mind is here deciding right or wrong,0
Did I mess up all along,0
"As I scroll up, looking through my older pictures",0
Bitches buzzing up the phone for me or just my riches,0
Now I get suspicious,0
All from being so ambitious,1
Now I see the circle vicious,0
Searching for satisfaction,0
Only getting a fraction of that feeling,0
And it’s fucking up my intuition,0
Now they wanna steal,0
[Pre-Chorus: KSI],0
'Cause a nigga only loyal as their last meal,1
Got a half a milli stacking on my last deal,1
And they wonder why I'm paranoid,0
"’Cause they jump, man, just to get that Jumpman (Yeah)",1
[Chorus: KSI &,0
Randolph,0
],0
"Damn, I'm on red alert (Red alert)",1
"Else you'll end up in the dirt, man",1
I don't wanna hurt man,0
"Nah, I don't wanna hurt (Wanna)",1
Champagne popping,1
How I wanna let it rain (Rain),1
"And they know that (Agh, agh)",0
I'm on red alert (Red alert),0
"Else you end up in the dirt, man",0
I don't wanna hurt man,0
"Nah, I don't wanna hurt (Nah)",0
Champagne popping,0
"Still, I’m watching all you Judas motherfuckers",1
"I got eyes on my surroundings
Enemies worth money
But family’s worth diamonds
Friends come and go
When it rains, when it snows
But the loyal ones stay
Through the pain, through the cold",0
[Verse 2: Randolph],0
"Uh, humble beginnings and now I'm making strides",0
"Ain’t nuttin' changed, but the rhythm and the rhymes",0
"Threw the dice, yeah",0
"Now I'm living life, yeah",0
"I'm on the road and I got all of the lights, yeah",0
"But still, I ain’t got it all",0
"I'm still searching, yeah",0
Shrunk the circle but they still lurking,0
"Fuck it, tonight we raising the glass high",0
Everybody eating 'cause that's how we live the best life,0
But I see the fakes from the real,0
"I see the jealousy build, yeah",0
I see the way that you feel,0
"I see them eyeing my deal, yeah (Yeah)",0
They must think that I'm blind,0
"Get yours, I get mine",0
'Cause I ain't playing with that time,0
That's why I'm (Ay),0
