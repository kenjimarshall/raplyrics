[Intro],0
Yeah,0
Ain't no fucking way I’m going back,0
Got way too much shit to take care of,0
And I'm having way too much fun pissing y'all off,1
It’s starting to look real rough out here for y'all,0
It's just the beginning too,0
"Yeah, come on, come on (Yeah)",0
[Chorus],0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
To splittin' five on McDoubles,0
I ain’t goin’ back (I ain't goin’ back),0
"To when there was no Russ, just Russell",0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin’ back),0
"To when mom cried so much, it left a puddle",0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
But I stay tapped in to that hustle,0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
To splittin' five on McDoubles,0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
"To when there was no Russ, just Russell",0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
"To when mom cried so much, it left a puddle",0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
But I stay tapped in to that hustle,0
[Verse 1],0
"Yeah, I go way harder than most of y'all",0
"If one of y'all died, wouldn't toast to y'all",0
I don't really care to get close to y'all,0
"I live in a gym, I'm supposed to ball",0
Mom was applying for the food stamps,0
Every night studio boot camps,0
All I had there was a lot of free time,0
Cheap wine and my mind and my two hands,0
And the same confidence that I have right now,0
It was more back then to be honest,0
Before the world got a hold of me and started controlling me,0
Now I'm more tapped in to the comments than I should be,0
"I admit that, so fuck y'all, give me my dick back",0
Middle finger gift wrap for the chit chat,0
And to anyone thinkin' I should quit rap,0
[Chorus],0
I ain't goin' back now (I ain't goin' back),0
To splittin' five on McDoubles,0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
"To when there was no Russ, just Russell",0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
"To when mom cried so much, it left a puddle",0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
But I stay tapped in to that hustle,0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
To splittin' five on McDoubles,0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
"To when there was no Russ, just Russell",0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
"To when mom cried so much, it left a puddle",0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
But I stay tapped in to that hustle,0
[Verse 2],0
Who's in my league? Not you,1
Who makes your beats? Not you,1
Who does your hooks? Not you,1
"Bitch I'm elite, top 2",1
"And not 2, bitch, I'm the one",1
It's crazy to think that I barely begun,0
Already on Forbes,1
", Already in Staples",0
I still got four years 'til my twenties are done,0
"I'm having my fun, my house is a brothel",0
"I'm fucking a Baptist, her pussy is gospel",0
"Your life is awful, that ain't my fault",0
"Yell at your mirror, go talk to your god",0
"I'm not letting up, fuck how you feel",0
I got my boots laced and I'm out,0
I threw 20k in my studio,0
"I brought the blue flame to my house, bitch",0
[Chorus],0
"I ain't goin' back, ah (I ain't goin' back)",0
To splittin' five on McDoubles,0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
"To when there was no Russ, just Russell",0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
"To when mom cried so much, it left a puddle",0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
But I stay tapped in to that hustle,0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
To splittin' five on McDoubles,0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
"To when there was no Russ, just Russell",0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
"To when mom cried so much, it left a puddle",0
I ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back),0
But I stay tapped in to that hustle (Yeah),0
