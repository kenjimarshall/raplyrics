"Even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die",1
"Horoscopes often lie,",1
and sometimes 'y',1
"Nothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever",1
"But until they close the curtain (y'all know), it's him and I: Aquemini",1
[Verse 1: Big Boi],1
"Now is the time to get on, like Spike Lee said, ""Get on the Bus""",1
"Go get your work and keep your beeper chirpin', it's a must",1
"Is you on that dust or cornstarch? Familiar with that smack, man?",1
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man,1
"Pacman,",1
"how in the fuck do you think we gon' do that, man?",1
"Ridin' round Old National on 18's without no gat, man",1
"I'm strapped, man, and ready to bust on any nigga like that, man",1
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin,1
We prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it was fitting,1
But now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners that we be bending,1
"In Volkswagens and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes",1
"If you ain't got no rims, nigga, don't get no wood grain steering wheel",1
"For real, you can go on chill out and still build, let your paper stack",1
"Instead of going into overkill, pay your fuckin' beeper bill, bitch",1
[Chorus: André 3000],1
"Even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die",1
"Horoscopes often lie,",1
"and sometimes ""y""",1
"Nothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever",1

[Verse 2: André 3000],1
"Twice upon a time, there was a boy who died",1
"Lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter",1
Live from home of the brave with dirty dollars,1
And beauty parlors and baby ballers and bowling ball Impalas,1
"And street scholars, majoring in culinary arts",1
"You know, how to work bread, cheese, and dough",1
"From scratch, but see the catch is you can get caught",1
"Know what ya selling, what you bought, so cut that big talk",1
"Let's walk to the bridge, meet me halfway",1
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway,1
It's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady,1
"It's lookin' bad, need some hope, like the words 'maybe', 'if', or 'probably'",1
"More than a hobby,",1
"when my turntables get wobbly, they don't fall",1
"I'm sorry y'all, I often drift,",1
I'm talking gift,1
So when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill,1
Of course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news,1
"Don't want to be it but it's needed, so what have you?",1
Now question: is every nigga with dreads for the cause?,1
Is every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw,1
So don't get caught up in appearance,1
"It's OutKast's Aquemini, another black experience",1

[Verse 3: Big Boi],1
"The name is Big Boi, Daddy Fat Sax, the nigga that like them Cadillacs",1
I stay down with these streets 'cause these streets is where my folks at,1
"Better know dat, some say we pro-black, but we professional",1
We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional,1
Get off the testicles and the nutsacks,1
"You bust rhyme, we bust back",1
Get-get back for real niggas that's out here tryin' to spit facts,1
"You hear dat? You can't come near dat, maybe you need to quit",1
Because Aquemini is Aquarius and  Gemini runnin' shit like this,1
[Verse 4: André 3000],1
"My mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten",1
"Meet the twin—André Ben,",1
welcome to the lion's den,1
"Original skin, many men comprehend",1
I extend myself so you go out and tell a friend,1
Sin all depends on what you believing in,1
Faith is what you make it—that's the hardest shit since MC Ren,1
Alien can blend right on in with your kin,1
"Look again, 'cause I swear I spot one every now and then",1
"It's happening again, wish I could tell you when",1
"André, this is André, y'all are just gon' have to make amends",1
[Chorus: André 3000],1
"Even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die",1
"Horoscopes often lie,",1
"and sometimes ""y""",1
"Nothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever",1
"But until they close the curtain, it's him and I: Aquemini",1
[Skit: André 3000],1
"Master: Finally, Igor! We've done it, we've done it!",1
"Igor: Yes, master! Yes, master!",1
"Master: Igor, we've done it!",1
Both: Uh-oh,1
