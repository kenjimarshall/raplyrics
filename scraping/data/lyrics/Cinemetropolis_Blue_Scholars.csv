This is the scene you been seeing all your life,1
The one inside a dream you repeated every night,1
For 24 frames every second through the light,1
Projected through the screen you been paying for despite,1
"What you see and what you hear, contrary to your sight",1
Everything you ever learned that you never had to live,1
Might've heard from a story teller medium,1
"Pictures, words, scriptures to cinema script",1
Writing a verse,0
From this city emerges a new generation of babies,1
"Who came out of the womb, glued to the tube",1
With plans and aspirations to prove beyond doubt,1
"We are stars too, even if it's just cartoons",1
My animated hands that I got from the,0
Genes of my island native fam I could never not be,1
I'm here to make them scream like a Hitchcock dame,1
"Whether analog, digital, shit is all the same",1
"An American tradition, a narrative for fiction",1
A Hamilton for tickets,1
",",0
the public is addicted,1
Just think for a second how much we've been conditioned,1
"To root for the Doughboys, the O-Dogs, the Bishops",1
"Sided with them villains, in spite of what they heeded",1
"He said she gotta have it, she said she didn't need it",1
"And even if she see it, she will probably not believe it",1
If it ain't bein' projected in a wide screen theatre,1
"If it spins on a reel, it's gotta be real",1
But 'real' in real life just remind us of film,1
And now you saying something's like a movie when it's real,1
Like a film's much realer than anything you feel,1

In a Cinemetropolis (in a Cinemetropolis),1
In a Cinemetropolis (in a Cinemetropolis),1
In a Cinemetropolis (in a Cinemetropolis),1
In a Cinemetropolis (in a Cinemetropolis),1
In a Cinemetropolis...,1

They try to say we bad kids from the start,1
"Grandchildren of Marx and Coca-Cola, yet quoting Godard",1
And you saying that everything is cinema since,1
The moving pictures in the center of your living room telling you shit,1
"Like you’ll never be shit, walk away from all your dreams",1
"Spark up, drop a lighter on a trail of gasoline",1
Leading back to the vehicle you crashed before you came,1
"Never looking back, cut, boom, end of scene",1
We’ve been gunning for that hundred and some change,1
The flicks and the flickering flames that been going the same length,1
Doing battle with the powers that be,1
That’ll be no longer in position when the power’s getting seized,1
So cameras we got redirected from the poor,1
"I directed for my people,",1
*Lino Brocka with the horn*,1
When the brother yelled ‘action’ it wasn’t just for his act,1
‘Cause he wanted to see the masses get they asses out the door (get up),1
"My marvelous marksmanship is sharp, shit is hard",0
"But we make it look not, we auteurs",0
"The Godfather poster on the wall, 14",0
"With a movie in my head, writing’s the next thing",1
So we shot y’all 35 millimeter rockstars,0
How about some hardcore senior to your sophomores,1
Flyer than a Concorde landing on your concourse,0
"Rolling with the vanguard, burning down your art house",0
"If it’s spinning on a reel, it’s gotta be real",1
But 'real' in real life just remind you of film,1
And now you saying something's like a movie when it's real,1
"Blade running like a samurai, killing himself",1
