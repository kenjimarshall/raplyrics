"H.O.C., H.O.C",1
All the real smokers get me H.O.C,1
All the real smokers get me H.O.C,1
"H.O.C., H.O.C",1
All the real smokers get me H.O.C,1
All the real smokers get me H.O.C,1
[Verse 1],0
Everybody know I spit that other shit,1
Shit that make you duck for cover shit,1
Shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit,1
Especially when Drop drop the beat,1
I drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs,1
Jump in the booth and shatter every rapper's dream,0
They jump in a sauna because I killed their self-esteem,1
"That's a jab, you should bob and weave",1
Like Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve,1
I go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd,0
Cause I'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb,0
You telling me the kush make you think on level four?,0
"I'm on five, you saying that I can level more?",0
"In high school, my teachers thought I was smoking stress",0
Didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects,0
I stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time,1
"Creation of man, and Columbine",1
[Chorus],0
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote,1
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro,1
"(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke",1
"I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke",1
I really appreciate that you share your Indo,1
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go,1
"I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke",1
"I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke",1
[Verse 2],0
"Look, nowadays everybody think they're big chiefers",1
Just cause they heard that new tape from Wiz Khalifa,1
Knowing damn well they can't hit the sour,1
"They're new booties, they probably need baby powder",1
My skill shower over your city for 40 days,1
"40 nights, off the chain, like freedom of slaves",1
"Before you get it twisted, like 40 gays",1
"My flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised",1
Those the type of lines that I'm talking 'bout,0
You know the type of rhymes you don't talk about,0
Copy my session on a disc when the session ends,0
So my momma can have it and play it for her friends,0
"Brag on me, like ""My son's 'bout to win",0
"Somehow, someday, and I don't care when""",0
I might hit the gin once a month,1
"I'll let you inhale, like an atheist",1
[Chorus],0
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote,1
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro,1
"(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke",1
"I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke",1
I really appreciate that you share your Indo,1
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go,1
"I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke",1
"I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke",1
[Verse 3],0
I'll take you back to the 9th grade,0
When Dough Boy had me high for 4 days,0
"That's my nigga, he a street nigga",0
"Probably in your hood, fucking up your street, nigga",0
But anyway I think it was some purple,1
"Told me ""Don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you""",1
"I didn't listen, I was floating like the Rose Parade",1
Swear to God a nigga seen some flying fishes,1
"That was the Vegas trip, Hooters sponsored",1
The same time I start writing like a fucking monster,1
I'm Frankenstein every time this mothafucker ponders,1
"Just underline every letter, capital K-D-O-T",0
"Laying it flat out, like a tire with slow leaks",0
Now what you 'bout? Nothing huh,1
Am I a square cause I don't puff a square?,0
Are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? Yeah,0
[Chorus],0
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote,1
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro,1
"(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke",1
"I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke",1
I really appreciate that you share your Indo,1
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go,1
"I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke",1
"I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke",1
[Outro],0
"H.O.C., H.O.C",1
All the real smokers give me H.O.C,1
(Bitch I'm blowed!),0
