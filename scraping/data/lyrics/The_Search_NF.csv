"""Hey, Nate, how's life?""",0
"I don’t know, it's alright",0
I've been dealin’ with some things like every human being,0
And really didn't sleep much last night,0
"""I'm sorry,"" that's fine",0
I just think I need a little me time,0
I just think I need a little free time,0
"Little break from the shows and the bus rides, yeah",0
Last year I had a breakdown,1
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud,1
"Had to see a therapist, then I found out",1
Somethin' funny’s goin’ on up in my house,1
"Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out",1
"You know, pack my cart, take a new route",1
"Clean up my yard, get the noose out",0
"Hang up my heart, let it air out",0
I’ve been searchin',0
"""What does that mean, Nate?"" I've been learning",0
"Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavin’ my burdens",1
"Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect",1
"Lookin' at the view, like this concerns me",0
"Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous",0
"Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry",0
And things might hurt me,0
"It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey",0
"It's worth it, though",0
"Cold world out there, kids, grab your coat",0
"It's been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam",1
Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code,0
"Pretty vivid; I admit it, I'm in classic mode",0
"Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone",0
"Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes",0
"I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it?",1
Been makin' a whole lot of changes,1
"Wrote a song about that, you should play it",1
I get scared when I walk on these stages,1
"I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah",1
That's when I start to get anxious,1
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous,1
That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred,1
"Forget what I'm saying, and—",1
Where'd the beat go?,0
"Oh, ain't that somethin'?",0
"Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'",0
"Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'",0
"Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach",1
Throw it back up like I don't want it,1
"Wipe my face, clean off my vomit",1
"OCD, tryna push my buttons",1
"I said don't touch it, now y'all done it",1
"I can be critical, never typical",0
"Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal",0
"Intimate, but never political, pretty visual",0
"Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though",0
"You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable",1
"Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool",0
"Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful",1
"Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (Videos, videos)",1
"Yeah, the sales can rise",0
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines,0
"See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside",0
"That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies",0
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives,0
Then it comes up out of nowhere like an evil surprise,0
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies,0
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am,0
The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place,0
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way,0
"It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe",0
"Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?",0
"Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face",0
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great,0
"You'll never be great—not because you're not, but the hate",0
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith (Woo),0
"I've been developin', take a look at the benefits",0
"Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate",0
Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it,0
"Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence",0
Pretty evident; dependable can never be tentative,0
"I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine",0
"Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip",0
"Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah",0
It's that time again,1
Better grab your balloons and invite your friends,1
"Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in",1
"Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big",1
On a road right now that I can't predict,0
"Tell me ""Tone that down,"" but I can't resist",0
"Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist",0
"The search begins, I'm back, so enjoy the trip, huh",1
