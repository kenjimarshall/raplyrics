"Uh, they just can't understand or fathom my demeanor",0
Unapproachable appearance to how I pack the ninas,0

"Got love for guns and caine, let nothin' come between us",0
"You mistook me for a rapper, huh",0
"Well that makes me an actor, cause I would rather clap a gun",0
And buck on them niggas who hate,0
"Who wanna be in my shoes, live my life, but can't carry my weight",0
I understand that the envy is part of the game,0
"But make no mistake, you and I, we are not the same",0
"Naw, bitch, I'm liable to splatter ya shit",0
"Light up ya world, 'til you start to stagger and shit",0
Watch how them hollows straight rattle ya shit,1

The streets molded the man I am,0
"The pimp, the hustler, the crook, the killer, go-rilla",0
"Traits of a blow dealer, cost my fame",0
"I hustle, I'm rich, blow scrilla",1

crack change came from blow,1
"Push the O's, six lay close",1

[Verse 3: Pusha T],0
They call me Pusha for one reason,0
Cause I keep that sniff all seasons,0
Whether the price is up or down,0
"I keep a mound to pitch from, you don't have to shop around",1
"When it come to that money, I get stealth",0
"Three guns is fortune, and I don't mind sharing my wealth",0
"Dog, I know about life",0
"I been around the world thrice times, I mean what I say",1
"From that Panama sun, to France's Champs-Élysées",1
"Grind so deep-rooted, I can't turn away",0
To sell base is now somewhat therapeutic,0
"Hear what I say, please don't confuse it",0
"My verses heal, like Curt Mayfield's music",1
"(I'm your pusha!), damn right",1
I treat ya nose to hook ya,0
"And only pull back to cook ya, partner",0

[Verse 4: Roscoe P. Coldchain],0
"I be damned if I die of starvation, things is fucked up as is",0
So I bangs my cabbage; do you not know the most effective,0
"Way of gettin' money, pull yo gun - rapidly",0
And watch you see the situation be corrected,1
"Lord Heavens, why must I live so devilish",1
They say whatcha do comes back on you two times,1
"I shoulda been died, but I'm still walking around wit two nines",1
"Who wants to be a millionaire, me, and you ain't got no more life lines",0
"You a snitch nigga fighting crime, go ahead and tell the police",0
"Cause every move you make, I'mma throw a slug",0
"And hope you choke blood, nigga, on every breath you take",0
"Not to be broke, cause Coldchain fate witness",0
