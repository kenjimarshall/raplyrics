This shit is wicked on these mean streets,1
"None of my friends speak, we're all tryna win",1
"But then again, maybe it's for the best though",1
'Cause when they're sayin' too much,1
You know they're tryna get you touched,1
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out,1
Couldn't understand the mechanics,1
"And the workings of the underworld, granted",1
"Nine-to-five is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive",1
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot,1
"Life ills poisoned my body,",0
I used to say fuck mic skills,1
"I never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti",1
"That's right, it's wicked – that's life, I live it",1
"Ain't askin' for forgiveness for my sins,",1
ends,0
I break bread,1
with the late heads,0
Pickin' their brains for angles on,0
all the evils that the game'll do,1
"It gets dangerous, money and power is changin' us",1
"And now we're lethal, infected with D'evils",1

We used to fight for building blocks,1
Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killin',1
The closest of friends when we first started,0
But grew apart as the money grew and soon grew black-hearted,0
Thinkin' back when we first learned to use rubbers,1
"He never learned, so in turn I'm kidnappin' his baby's mother",1
"My hand around her collar, feedin' her cheese",1
"She said the taste of dollars was shitty, so I fed her fifties",1
About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced,1
I kept feedin' her money 'til her shit started to make sense,1
Who could ever foresee?,1
We used to stay up all night at slumber parties,1
Now I'm tryna rock this bitch to sleep,1
All the years we were real close,1
Now I see his fears through her tears,1
Know she's wishin' we were still close,1
"Don't cry, it is to be;",1
in time,1
"I'll take away your miseries and make it mine, D'evils",1

"My flesh no nigga could test, my soul is possessed",0
By D'evils in the form of diamonds and Lexuses,0
The Exorcist got me doin' sticks,1
"Like, ""Homie, you don't know me",1
"But the whole world owe me, strip!""",1
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fuckin' life,1
"So now I'm down for whatever, ain't nothin' nice",1
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly,0
But now this higher learning got the Remy in me,1
Liquor's invaded my kidneys,1
"Got me ready to lick off – Momma, forgive me",1
"I can't be held accountable, D'evils beatin' me down, boo",0
"Got me runnin' with guys, makin' G's, tellin' lies that sound true",0
"Come test me, I never cower",0
"For the love of money, son, I'm givin' lead showers",1
"Stop screamin', you know the demon said it's best to die",1
"And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify, D'evils",1
