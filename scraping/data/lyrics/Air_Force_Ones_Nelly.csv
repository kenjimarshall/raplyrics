"I like the all-white, high-top strap with the gum bottom",0
"There's somethin' bout 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em",0
I leave 'em strapped and laced,1
and come up out 'em,0
The last person that touched 'em I been shot 'em,0
[Verse 2: Kyjuan],0
"Now if you look, and see lime-green Forces; it's Kiwi",0

You know I keeps it hip-hop; my niggas flip-flop,0
"Yeah, my Force Ones in tip-top (me) now form a flip flops",0
[Verse 3: Ali],0

Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings,0

All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at,0
[Verse 4: Murphy Lee],0

You may not have three or four,0
"But you got one, man (big boy)",0

Purple in gold with the Lakers the Broncos the orange and blue,0
I like 'em floppy with ankle socks,0
"Lows mids and high tops,  which are clear so",0
But this tims and fat laces with it is cold,0
But when the winter go (burrr) and the hot summer flow,0
Then it's back to the all purpose wit them lil' dots in the toe,0
Then I'm stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sho,0
"On dem Nike Air Force, ""NE"" behind the ""O""",0
[Verse 7: Kyjuan],0
"O-kay Lee, I treat my shoe like my ride",0
Chrome on the fat laces at what wood on the inside,0
"Spray candy on the swoosh, with the electric roof",0
"Since I put a kit on the sole, I got a wider shoe",0
You see that low-mid Skittle purple coupe I'm drivin in,0

"Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin dem",0
"Ain't no point in tryin these on, you know I'm buyin dem",0

"Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight",0
The only problem they only good for one night,0
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night,0
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces,0
"This kid's outrageous, he's buyin them by the cases",0
Cause once I cop 'em gut 'em and switch the laces,0
They all purpose ya heard me kinda like my daytons,0
