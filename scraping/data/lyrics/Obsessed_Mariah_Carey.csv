[Intro],0
"I was like, ""Why are you so obsessed with me?""",1
"So oh, oh, oh, oh...",0
[Verse 1],0
All up in the blogs saying we met at the bar,0
When I don't even know who you are,0
"Saying we up in your house, saying I'm up in your car",0
"But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's",1
"I'm up in the A, you so, so lame",1
And no one here even mentions your name,1
"It must be the weed, it must be the E",1
"'Cause you be popping, heard you get it popping",1
[Chorus],0
"Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know",1
"Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows",1
It's clear that you're upset with me,1
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress,0
"Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this",1
"You're delusional, you're delusional",0
"Boy, you're losing your mind",0
"It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know",0
Why you wasting your time?,0
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex,1
Seeing right through you like you're bathing in Windex,1
[Post-Chorus],0
"Oh, oh, oh, oh",0
"Boy, why you so obsessed with me?",0
"So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh",0
(And all my ladies sing),0
"So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh",0
(And all the girls say),0
"Obsessed, obsessed, obsessed...",0
[Verse 2],0
"You on your job, you hating hard",0
"Ain't gon' feed you, I'mma let you starve",0
"Gasping for air, I'm ventilation",1
"You out of breath, hope you ain't waiting",1
Telling the world how much you miss me,0
"But we never were, so why you tripping?",0
"You a mom and pop, I'm a corporation",1
"I'm the press conference, you a conversation",0
[Chorus],0
"Why you so obsessed with me? and boy, I wanna know",1
"Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows",1
It's clear that you're upset with me,1
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress,1
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this,1
"You're delusional, you're delusional",0
"Boy, you're losing your mind",0
"It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know?",0
Why you wasting your time?,0
