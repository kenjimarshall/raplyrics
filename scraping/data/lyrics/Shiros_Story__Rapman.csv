Yeah it's been all goin' down yo,0
Kiera and her big bro,0
Feds plus Kyle all been on the hunt for Shiro,0
But Shiro ain't about,0
He's been missin' like 6 months straight,0
He shuffled to the airport den headed straight to the gate,0
He took Kyla on the plane,0
And he jetted off to Spain,0
Kiera's come to terms with never seeing her again,0
"Older brother's telling her ""it's gonna be okay""",0
But she's numb to the words,0
All she feels is the pain,0
She don't her big brother got Shiro's mum,0
He ain't lettin' her go free until she brings her son,0
"Shiro's got the words, now Shiro's coming back",0
He's rushing to the airport cos he didn't even pack,0
They said they wan't Kyla plus 100k racks,0
And he agreed to it all just to get his mum back,0
Ten hours later Shiro's back and above,0
Only thing that's on his mind is saving his mother,0
Heading to that postcode that they sent him,0
"No mandem, no weapons",0
Just Kyla and the cash,0
He knows it wasn't smart,0
But he's thinking with his heart,0
Plus they told him come alone or his mother's getting clapped,0
"He finally pulls up, they can see dat he's there",0
"He stepped out the car, Kyla sleepin' in the chair",0
He sees a bag of bodies walking in his direction,0
"Shiro's real scared, man he can't even front",0
And as they get closer in deeper inspection,0
"He sees that it's Kiera, her brother and his bunch",0
Kiera sees his face and her body starts to jump,0
"Shiro knows she's pissed, he's preparing for a brunt",0
"As soon as she reaches, she starts to attack",0
Her brother makes it clear that he's not to fight back,0
"And she just started licking him, and kicking him",0
Yelling at while hitting him,0
Older bro said hit him hard,0
But Kiera stopped she ain't listening,0
She sees Kyla in the car,0
She rushes right over and she puts her in her arms,0
"Kyla still asleep, Kiera wakes her up calm",0
Shiro tried to stop her but they dragged him by his arm,0
They took him upstairs,0
His mum was tied up flat to a chair,0
"Soon as he saw, man he rushes over there",0
"I swear if she's hurt, you're all dead I don't care",0
This nigga's gone mad,0
"Fam ain't nobody scared
Hear what I'm sayin', where's my 100 bands g
It's all their in the bag, you can count it and see
Brudda dat was for my sis, I need suttin for me
As a consequence taking my niece oversea's
I should slap him in his head, chop his body into three
Naa man can let him live, for a small amount p
I see how you gettin' bread, I need suttin' for me
Line it up now, on my life you go free
I ain't got no money left
Shiro really tried to explain
Dat that money that money that he gave he was the last to his name
But they didn't wanna listen, they think he's runnin' games
Said that if he can't pay he gets a bullet to his brain
He told them ""okay that he can get 'em their p""
But he's gotta hit road, so he needs a couple weeks
Look, you got five days, keep thinking I'm joking
You and your mum, 6 feet under roses
Hear what I'm sayin' I need all my bread
And dat little pussio yute Kyle dead
Cah couple months back he put hands on my sis
And I'm this close to ahh, slap off a wig
You got five days left
Bitch get to work
My bread and Kyle or your face in the dirt
They gun buck Shiro, had him bleed from his face
But It coulda been worse, man it coulda been the case
The very next day
Shiro sent his mum away
She asked and begged him please not to stay
Said she's not leaving unless he comes with her
He said they get Kyla and then they cut with her
His mother went away so he knew that she was safe
But that's just one problem of a load thats on his plate
Cos now he's on his face-down to his last racks
The night he sent them young g's to pill Kyle's cap
Yeah they all missed Kyle but hit a girl in the back
That girl passed away in the paramedics lap
They all got a 'M'
So Shiro gave 100k to everyone of them
Cos they all could've snitched
But none of dem didn't bend
So now he needs the p's and he's got kill Kyle
Or else he runs away and he forgets about his child
(Or else he runs away and he forgets about his child)

[Verse 2: Shiro, Kyle]
Meanwhile back in the ends
Kyle built a green line, anything from a 9's to a benz
He's got dem flavours, the ammi and that Cal kush
Ring-ring trap, that phones Jumpy like Ambush
Got a couple of young g's who run it for him daily
A g called Little T and another young boy named Bailey
Bailey came through from a friend of a friend
And Young T been a young g, been on the ends
True he's making them eat they stay loyal to him
He's ain't as rich as he wants but he's getting it in
One day when they was chillin' on the block
Bailey's on shift, a cat called so he had to buss a shot
So it's Young T, Tiny and Kyle at the spot
They're all holding it down while he handles the gwop
They clock someone walking towards them
It's hard to make out cos they're coming from afar
They're thinking ah shit man it might be Keira's brother and that
But more time them man roll up in cars
But then Kyle clocked, he recognised the bop
He can't believe his eyes Shiro's walking on his block
His face fully shocked, he runs right at him cos he wants to whack him up
But Shiro moves straps so he starts to back him up
So you man wanna listen or you wanna get shot?
Keira's brother told me I should put you in a box
Well then do it then, what?
Tell Kyron fuck him and that his sister's a thot!
And fuck you too, you better run back my gwop
I ain't running back shit, are you listening or not?
I nearly died in that room, don't ever think that I forgot
I got Keira down and you're the next one to drop
Fam he kidnapped my mum, he had a tied up for days
Fed her water with crumbs, gave him Kyla and my belly
And he's still lookin funds
And he wants you dead, he's looking for your head
And he said that if I don't bring it that there's nowhere I can run Look, me and you, we can keep going at it
And the winner gets Kyron and his goons
Or we can come together, take him out and then sort them issues between me and you
Kyle wasn't sure he was sitting on the fence
But the more he thought about it, the more it made sense
So they both agreed put their ting to an end
The enemy or the enemy is better as a friend
(So they both agreed put their ting to an end
The enemy or the enemy is better as a friend)

[Verse 3: ""Kyla"", Shiro, Kiera, Bailey]
Last couple days before Shiro's gotta pay
Needs to get Kyron down, thinks he's figured out a way
He's been preeing on his snap for him to screen where he's at
If the place ain't too bait, he's going there with the strap
Kyron's been snapping that he needs to get a trim
Shiro's thinking Yes if he goes then it's him
Cos he knows about the spot, some small barber shop
Ain't no cameras on that road, guaranteed he's getting popped
Kyron's next snap is him driving in the whip says he's going barber shop. Showtime this is it
Shiro calls Kyle and he tells him the drop says to meet him there now up the road from the shop
Kyle's there quick with his two young bucks, black gloves in a ringer, both of them are strapped up
They know Kyron's there cos his car's outside and as soon as he steps out, yeah that's boom bye-bye
Shiro's not sure if he can even take a life
But for Kyla and his mum you better know he's gonna try
Kyle's fully on it, Young T been crazy but there's something funny, something dodgy 'bout Bailey
He says to let him out man, he's moving bare boog
Kinda acting like Trey from 'Boyz n the Hood'
So Kyle lets him out then he follow him around
Shiro's like ""where you going, it's about to go down""
Kyle says ""just wait there"" he's going to come back around
But these times now, Kyrons on the chair
His phone's beating off while he's tryna to cut his hair
Shiro and Young T are waiting right outside there
Kyle never came back but fuck that, he don't care
When Kyron steps out he's gonna end it right here
Kyron's on the phone, he's saying ""how you know?""
He jumps out the chair and runs straight into the road
He pulls his strap from his waist
Then he starts to let it go
Bullets banging on the car, Shiro's ducking down low
Young T bucks back, Shiro let a couple go
Banging out on the mains, and lighting up the whole road
But Young T he gets hit, shoulder and his elbows
And now Young T's down and Shiro's gun's empty, he's shot his last round
Shiro's trapped in, it's all fucked for him now
Kyron's got a clear shot and he's 'bout to lick him down (fuck)
But Kyle comes out of nowhere, and he's firing out all of them rounds
Don't care about all of them sirens den
Now he's tryna get the man down
Yeah Kyron man he had to fall back, he ain't tryna lay in that ground
Jumped in his whip like real quick and ducked outta that town
Right now it's all mad
Shiro messed up, missed the one chance he had
Whoever tipped Kyron off, fucked him up bad
He knows that it's Kyle, man he bet all we had
But if not for Kyle, he'd be laid in a bag
At least he's alive though, for that though he's glad
His phone starts ringing, it's a Facetime call
Yeah he picks it up but he waits for them to talk
Den he hears the words ""Hi daddy, you okay?""
It's Kyla was baby missed here like cra'
They talked for a bit but then Kiera takes the phone
Then Shiro, he switched JUST LEAVE US ALONE
Looks Shiro, we really need to talk
I'm sorry for everything I've done
But first off, I wanna start by saying that I never knew about Kyron and your mum (What ever)
I found out on the day I saw you
And I begged him to please let her go
I'm so sorry for the way I attacked you
My hear was so broken that I lost controll
I dont know what you did to Kyron
But right now he really wants you dead (FUCK KYRON!)
Now you can stay and end up getting killed
Or we can run away together instead (Are you for real)
Yeah we both hurt eachother
But in the mix we've hurt Kyla more
I can bring that money that you gave my brother
And we can use it for just us four
What you talking 'bout four, you forgot how to count
Ohh I get it, you wanna bring your boyfriend Kyle
Yes I know how to count, and I did mean four
I'm six months pregnant, I'm carring you child
Shiro goes quiet from the shock
She ",0
explanes,0
all the dates was the night before he left,0
Saying that she swears on her life that he's the dad,0
And its been like a year since her and Kyle had sex,0
And then goes on to tell him that there having a boy,0
It's like a dream come true,0
Shiro's body's filled up with joy,0
He agree's that they all should just leave,0
They should meet up in a hour,0
"No games, no play",0
"A hours gone by, Shiro's wating at the spot",0
He's not wating too long before a Uber makes a drop,0
Kyla comes out and Kiera comes after,0
"The vibes all nice, bare smilin', bare laphter",0
Shiro quickly puts Kyla in the car,0
Then walks up to Kiera and feels her on her bum,0
And while his hands movin' over her belly,0
The baby starts to kick and then his heart starts to jump,0
At the the very same time another cars pulling up,0
It's Kyron and his goons,0
"They followed Kiera there, but Kiera never knew",0
Kiera tried to tell 'em they should leave him alone,0
"But Kyron doesnt listen, says that Shiro's gotta go",0
He backs out his gun and then he aims it at Shiro,0
"And then he asks him, are you ready to die?",0
Shiro asks him the same as that question,0
Smile on his face while he's looking in his eyes,0
You see the one thing that Kyron didn't know,0
"Is Shiro didn't slip, he never came there alone",0
He kinda sort of knew that dem man might come through,0
So he made a couple of calls and brought friends of his own,0
The plug he came through with a bag of his soldiers,0
And Kyle he jumped out with his young boy Bailey,0
"So dats more guns, more bodies, more ammo",0
Kyron can't win he's outnumbered crazy,0
So Shiro gave Kyron a choice,0
"He can stay and die, or he can just leave",0
"But Kyron's not dumb, he sees Shiro's won",0
"So he ducks in his car, no more tricks up his sleave",0
So Shiro thanks the plug for his help,0
The plug and his soldiers they all leave the scene,0
"Shiro and Kiera were finnaly together with Kyla, it feels like a dream",0
They're 'bout drive off into the sunset,0
But den Kyle he walks over the car,0
Before Shiro gets to see wants,0
He clocks that boy Bailey just staring from a far,0
Yeah Kyle thinks he's wating for him,0
So shouts out to Bailey that he's comin' in a bit,0
But Bailey he's moving all crazy,0
He pulls out a gun and aims it straight at the whip,0
"Ayy Shiro you don't reall know me but trust me doe I know you
I'm the one who told Kyron you was there
I was hoping he will kill you
Six months ago a girl died outside a club, she was shot in the back
She was innocent and never hurt no one
So I don't understand why they done here done her like that
Three of her killers went to jail, but one of dem he got away free
Yeah I bet I know exactly what your thinking
What's this whole story really got to do with me?
We didn't find out until the morning
The police said that a straight bullet hit her
But I made a promise, if I ever got a chance (I'm sorry, I'm sorry, IT WAS A ACCIDENT)
I will get revenge on who killed my big sister (I'm sorr')
So this is for her",0
