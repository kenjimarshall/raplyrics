Pocker think I'm selling A-class,0
"Went to see a doctor, he said my life was made up",0
What you do with no options?,0
"Like a squirrel for an acorn, pulling out my hair",0
I ain't getting no cornrows,0
Searching for gold at the end of the rainbow,0
"I'm at a yellow brick road, doing up angel",0
Tell her do it 'cus I say so,0
In Bagel King,0
"I ain't trying to get a Bagel, life of sin",0

"Thorn in my foot, no one helped me out",0
"I'm not unpure, neither good, like that's not allowed",0

"Never got a response, only asked as a child",0
"Been unsure on trial, I'm sure that I'll walk this aisle",0
"Caught this flight, deja vu, already lived this life",0

But it's scumbag season,0
I'll come back when no comeback needed,0
Man like lil' Joab squeezing,0
Prolly smoke more I'm leaning,0
8 year old's blow bags breathing,0
Nowadays cognac sipping,1
Back then? Scumpy sipping,1
"Lambrini, never wore Cabrini",1
Gotta find my Avirex,1
They'll sell themselves short for flavors,0
I wouldn't sell myself out for dough and acres,0
I want a wife that's gracious,0
Then we can get a yard that's big in Barbados,0
I appreciate queens 'cus they made us,0
"I'll part the sea, what's your fragrance, tasting like Baileys",0
Put me in a spell like seance,0
