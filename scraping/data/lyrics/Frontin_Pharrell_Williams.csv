[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams],0
Don't wanna sound full of myself or rude,1
But you ain't looking at no other dudes,1
"'Cause you love me (I'm sorry baby, so sexy)",1
So you think about a chance,0
You find yourself trying to do my dance,0
"Maybe 'cause you love me (Uh, you do it well)",0
[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams],0
So then we tried singing it slow now,0
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (Fast we touched),0
Then we locked eyes and I knew I was in there,0
And I was gon' tear your ass up (Tear your ass up),0
[Chorus: Pharrell Williams],0
"I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off",0
"I was just frontin' (You know I want you, babe)",0
"I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all",0
"But you know I want ya (You should stop frontin', babe)",0
[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams],0
Trying to be the best girlfriend you could be,0
"But still you sneak and look at me, and girl, I love it",0
Then you give your other girl a shove,0
Tell her you gonna call her ass how it was,0
"And she's gonna love it (Whoa-oh whoa, yeah, yeah)",0
[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams],0
So then we tried singing it slow now,0
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (Fast we touched),0
Then we locked eyes and I knew I was in there,0
And I was gon' tear your ass up (Tear your ass up),0
[Chorus: Pharrell Williams],0
"I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off",0
"I was just frontin' (You know I want you, babe)",0
"I'm ready to bury it all, unless you don't care at all",0
"But you know I want ya (You should stop frontin', babe)",0

Ho!,0
"We got another one, Phar-real!",0
"Dance, oooohhh",0
"I call you ""for real"" cause you the truth, haha",0
"Whoa-oh, ohhh-ohh",0
"Young, great Hova",0
"Dance, oooohhh",0
"Uh, yeah, let me talk to 'em",0
"Whoa-oh, ohhh-ohh",0
I'mma keep it real,0
[Verse 3: Jay-Z & Pharrell Williams],1
Every time your name was brought up,1
I would act all nonchalant in front of an audience,1
Like you was just another shorty I put the naughty on,1
"But uh, truth be told, you threw me for a loop, this Hov",1
I'm too old to be frontin' what I'm feelin',0
"Denzelin', actin' like you ain't appealin' when you are",1
Stuntin' like you ain't my only girl when you are,0
(I was just frontin'),0
I'm ready to stop when you are,0
[Chorus: Pharrell Williams],0
"I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off",0
"I was just frontin' (You know I want you, babe)",0
"I'm ready to bury it all, unless you don't care at all",0
"But you know I want ya (You should stop frontin', babe)",0
[Outro: Pharrell Williams],0
C'mon (ho!),0
"Dance, oooohhh",0
"Whoa-oh, (oh), ohhh-ohh",0
"Dance, oooohhh (aoww!)",0
"Whoa-oh, (oh), ohhh-ohh",0
